2013-04-24,91310,True,Dead island is one of those game where you can overloom it's flaws because there is shuch a great and meaty combat system to be found here. The graphics are pretty bad and there a quite a few bugs but underneath that there is a good game to be found. 7.5/10
2013-04-24,22300,True,This is probaly one of the best rpg games i have ever played. As soon as you start playing this game you will be hooked. It's That good. The enemies are fun to fight and the V.A.T.S system is very slick. The inventory and ai could be better. But i can overlook those flaws when there is soo much to do here. i recommend this game to any RPG fan. 10/10!!
2013-04-24,96800,True,This is a pretty blatent spin off of quake. Nexuiz is an arean fps game running on cryengine 3. It might look good but that is the only good thing about this game. The gameplay feels dated and rubbish. 5/10
2013-04-24,1250,True,If you liked Left 4 Dead you should loiek this game. For a low budget game it is pretty good. The Aim of the game is to survive all the waves and defeat the boss. After each wave you get to go to a trader to spend your cash on weapons and upgrades. Fun C-op game. The Graphics could be better and the ai is pretty rubbish but other than that you should have a good time. 7/10
