Smite also offer special MOTD (Match of the Day) with mild to intensive shenanigans and 5 other modes that brings something different to the table. The art style of this game is absolutely great (well, depends if you have a potato, this goes for the graphics also) and brings an almost accurate depiction of the gods and goddesses. The game also hosts or has special weekends where you can earn bonus gems and favours (in-game currency), which can be one of the worst weeks of smite. To top it all off, the game itself isn't too bad and can be heaps of fun (have friends play with you). And beware of the odyssey and treasure chests, unless you want to take your chances (but both of them are a great addition to smite) because your wallets might disappear."
