2015-11-20,109600,True,A game you can play on your laptop and even have parts you can do on your mobile such as crafting which is cool.Easy to jump in and play solo for a bit level up or two and then log out easilyEasy to play - just follow the pixie dust - although its good to take it off so you can just explore on your own. The only bad point I have come across at the moment is with the companions and horse as without grinding for hours and hours on end they only other way I can think of to upgrade them is to pay - even though I already paid at the start and found out after all my money had gone. - Note though if you buy a companion you dont need to pay to level them past 20
