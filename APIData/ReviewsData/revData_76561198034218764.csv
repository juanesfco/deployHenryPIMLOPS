2016-05-16,360620,False,"I don't usually write negative reviews, (if any reviews for that matter) and I must say, if you have recieved a coupon for this game and bought it, then refund it. Not worth $1.00, espicially not worth $10 for something a highschool teacher made since he had nothing better to do. Once launching in, firstly only 3 other players were online and did not act very nicely towards me. Secondly, even though it does say it's an early access game, its still in pre-alpha. Not even alpha, *PRE*TLDR; Spent $1.00 on a highschool project that is meant to be in 48 hour game jam for ~FREE~"

If your looking for a game to show off your skill and power this is the place."

2014-02-25,220240,True,Absolutely stunning graphics and the gameplay may be a tad repetitive but there is different elements which make it fun to play for hours on end. Highly recommend playing this game.
