2016-04-17,211420,True,"Dark Souls, an infamous game of death and learning. I sure havent finished it, but I really enjoy it, the death dosent feel like a punishment but a learning expirence. Dark Souls is harsh, unforgiving and deeply rewarding, even after several rage quits, yelling and screaming. Dark souls has given me an expirence ill never forget."

Its progression, its characters, its weapons, almost everything about it makes it a worthwile game, buy this game, you'll get countless hours of fun and a great expirence"
