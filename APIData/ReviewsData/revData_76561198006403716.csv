This game (as it is) is more about clicking to terraform, waiting for belief (the resource required to terraform), and even more waiting for your population/agriculture to grow. There is actually very little to do in this game besides watching a little bar on your screen filling up. There's no endgame in sight, and there's no real goal except to sit there and watch that damn bar go up.TL;DR: Don't buy until they actually have a game to play."
