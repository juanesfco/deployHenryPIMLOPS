This happens once, you think oh well try again.  After the tenth time you finally get jack of the game and move on.If developers are going to create a game with Perma-death, the golden rule is the only person who can kill the character is the player and their choices. Not glitches and bugs.Sorry but I'm moving on."

2014-11-18,282070,True,"Brilliant, haunting and addictive. This could be the basic concept for an epic big budget game, but would it lose some of its charm...?Highly recommended!"
2014-10-12,312210,True,"This is a very cool concept, can't wait to see how it pans out!A little bit clunky with menus and controls and a bit buggy but worth a look."
2014-08-15,22380,True,In my opinion Fallout 3 is one of the best games ever made. New Vegas continued the concept. What's not to like.Instant classic!
2014-08-15,274310,True,"One of the most frustrating games I have ever played. So much promise but I cannot stress highly enough, do not start playing this game.  If you do, many hours later you will finish it and be as irritated as i was."
2014-02-17,241540,True,"For what it is, this is a while lot of fun! If one of the big developers gets hold of this concept they could make a truly brilliant game to rival the Fallout series.  Great to see new imagination in the zombie genre!"
