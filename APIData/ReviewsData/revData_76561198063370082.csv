With the recent release of the Holodome DLC borderlands fans have been even more disspointed then with the release of Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt for Borderlands 2. A complete waste of money that now seems to make up a quarter of what the season pass provides. As it was recently announced that their would be only one campaign DLC for the pre sequel, I am left to wonder whether this $20 is even going to be worth it in the end. The one redeeming factor so far is that it seems like the character DLC's are very well made and hopefully this can make up for the pile of excrement that is the Holodome. For now I'd have to say it's not worth buying the season pass for this game. This opinion may change however with the release of upcoming content, we'll just have to wait and see."
2013-12-19,49520,True,"Brilliant game, an especially good game to pick up in the frequent steam sales for a few $. The sheer amount of weapons and content, as well as the unique DLC characters keep this game entertaining even after hours of gameplay."
2014-11-29,261640,True,"Definitely worth getting if you liked the previous games, the improvements to mobility lead to a much more interesting combat environment, and one where you are much less glued to the ground. The introduction of the new lazer weapons and the cryo element fit in seamlessly and generally improve the variation in strategy when facing enemies. Though many of the assets are re-used this doesn't hinder the gameplay in any way, and is to be expected in a game of this nature."
2014-12-29,237930,True,"One of the best games I have played this year, exceptionallly beautiful world design and a stunning soundtrack, coupled with incredibly fun and fluid gameplay, results in another brlliant title by Supergiant Games.Although the game itself is quite short, it has a great level of replayability and even a system within the game itself allowing you to continue with your characters level and abilities, and take them right through the game again.Anyone around looking for a good game to chuck a few hours of utter enjoyment into should look no further!"
2014-12-17,200510,True,"Still with many bugs even after this much time, broken sight lines, strange enemy drop-ins, and much more glitchyness. But despite all this it still remains a very good game. As a modern turn based strategy game it's definitely the best I've played. It's a brilliant game to play through over and over. Whether it be pushing for the harder difficulties, striving to complete all the achievments or just relaxing while your archangel snipers pick off those pesky thin men. XCOM: Enemy Unknown and its partner DLC Enemy Within are a great game for the sake of replayablility and overall enjoyment.Definitly worth picking up if you're a fan of the genre."
2014-12-17,289881,False,"Many problems with this DLC, barely any actual content and extremely lacking in the features that are required in a borderlands slaughter dome.  -Reused music -Only one  actually new enemy -No real fix to the problem of non-respawnable bossesWhat the hell is 2K Australia thinking?I'd strongly suggest that anyone thinking of buying the season pass for this game reconsider immediatly simply because of this DLC, it is in no way worth the $10 that they seem to believe people will spend on it.To be blatently honest at this point it seems like Gearbox and 2K are just screwing with us, 4 promised campaign DLC's? Nope, only one. A brand new Slaughter dome? And this is all we get.When I first saw gameplay of this DLC I thought, 'Hell this looks like a dev version!' with nothing but limited amounts of reused enemies, a single boss, and weirdly broken loot... Unless by some amazing magic this turns out to be the case, do NOT buy this DLC.And as a final bit of brokenness it appears this has yet to be released on Mac. What a surprise."
