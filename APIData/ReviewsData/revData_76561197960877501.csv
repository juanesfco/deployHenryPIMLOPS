2014-03-28,234530,False,"DO NOT BUY! Read on! This is an alpha and full release review.I wouldn't go near this game until it has been released fully. Still keen? Expect 5gig+ patches every two weeks or monthly. I have downloaded over 20gig of patches in the last 8 weeks for stuff all changes, with that sort of patch volume I'd expect big changes or more content, neither were apparent. When you ask the devs whats up with the huge patches you will have the question removed from the forum, truly awesome work devs. The player base is tiny, being an Oceanic gamer it is even smaller, not even remotely worth it. My opinion; stick with War of roses, do not give these guys a dime until the finished product is out, they don't deserve it.FYI; take note of when the positive reviews for this game happened, very few people are happy with the state of play in 2014.POST FULL VERSION LAUNCH.The game is still garbage, the devs continue to push out 5gig patches every couple of weeks to add one or two swords or tweak a class. The game is a joke, the balance is getting worse, the combat clunkier, the range combat is a waste of time. The devs could care less about finishing as they could about adding more DLC for kids to buy. How you can release DLC less than a month after an official launch and not give to preaccess and alpha is disgusting and should tell you all you need to know about these devs and what they think of the consumer. War of Roses was/ is a better game; armor, range, better levels, mounted combat. Its just better (yes even with its current balance). War of vikings; waste of money, the devs should of kept working on roses, this is the same game with different textures, a clunkier-crappier combat system and none of the above mentioned features.
