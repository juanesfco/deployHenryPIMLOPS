My review is therefor influenced by the fact that, heading into this game, I was expecting something that offered freedom. I was dissapointed. The levels are completely linear and not at all what i was hoping for in a modern Hitman experience."
2014-09-13,261030,True,"I found i had far less connection with the characters in this season. Though i cant tell if that was a bad thing or not. Hell if we are playing as clem does that just mean clem feels the same way? :P At one point where clem dreams of Lee I actually got a little teary eyed. I, as Clem, missed Lee! That speaks to how good season one was and also how little i cared for the season two characters.On the gameplay side of things there are still some major issues. Movement through the environment is still terrible both in how you move and the speed at which you do so (Clem is a little girl living in the apocalypse yet when you control her she always walks at a snails pace!)."
2014-09-13,8870,True,People seem to be most impressed with this games story. The story was good but the way it tells the story is better. I was not at all surprised by the ending (it seemed fairly obvious) but i loved every step through its environments. There are some moments in this game where the art is breath taking. I often found myself just wandering around looking at things for no other reason than the fact it was fun...how many game environment are fun simply by walking around them?! I took time looking for audio logs because the voice acting was so damn good. The gameplay was also great. Flying around on rails trying to escape some new enemy while almost dead was extremely exciting.  I just wish there was multiplayer...that would have made for some epic gaming :) Well worth the buy.
2014-09-13,242920,True,"Its decent. Can i recommend this game? Probably. Though not to too many people i think.It offers some cool mechanics and has an interesting take on the sim-strategy sort of genre. The fact that your population can (and will) die is a great idea. There are some AI issues and building restriction which, after hours of playing, start to get a little annoying. The fact that sometimes your road will be suddenly blocked by a tiny bit of hill was frustrating. Also, the visuals are a little dull. For me it became a little boring after several city starts. I wish there was more variety in the buildings and how things could be placed. I love the concept, dislike the UI and visuals but look forward to an improved sequel :). Hopefully the devs have made enough money to make that a reality."
