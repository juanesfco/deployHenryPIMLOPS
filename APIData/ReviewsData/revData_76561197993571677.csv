Heaps of options with the tech trees. Colonising planets gives me a boner, but taking over another faction's colonised planet is the height of pleasure for me. Working up towards building a big fleet is incredibly satisfying, as you build up your techs and number of ships per fleet, how far they can go, what weapons and armour they have. Not to mention the DESIGNER. Oh man. Sure, they have a (quite a large) finite number of blocks you can use per faction, but the ways you can COMBINE them is infinite. Honestly. You could easily build a ship out of any one block type, as each block comes in a certain style and appearance that can be shrunk/expanded/rotated/moved/even ANIMATED (ie moving parts), you can easily design unique ships that you're not likely to see made by anyone else.Please play this game with me. The AI is pretty A-OK, but the only thing missing is the joy of stomping on enemy AI with fellow human allies, or even pit against each other.COME ON!!!9.5/10"

For those too impatient, send them some monies to support development and unlock those powerful heavy tanks, or the sniper class (aka recon), or a variety of explosives capable of destroying any tank (which might I say is incredibly rewarding seeing a US Pershing tank go up in flames).This is probably one of my latest top games I've ever played. I cannot put it down."
2015-01-20,305620,True,"Yet another interesting approach to the survival genre. No zombies or plagues, just you, the weather, and the wilderness. Keep your distance from rabid wolves while trying to crack open an ice hole to knab up a fish or two. Run through blizzards trying to find shelter - a hut, cabin, a car, a knook in a cliff.. ANYTHING to keep you warm while you chow down some scavenged nibbleys. As of January '15 this game has enough content to provide several hours of immersion and amusement. Wolf encounters are intense, resource finding can be tough yet rewarding, and the world varied. Which reminds me - I enjoyed how this game is animated. Most games these days are trying to be as realistic as possible. Borderlands attempts to create something vivid, interesting, with a somewhat low-def touch - The Long Dark *could* fall into the same category. This game is definitely not striving to achieve the *best* graphics out there, but I found it to be just as likeable.Edit: Really looking forward to extra updates from the developers. They've already increased the size of the map, adding a few more hours to my gameplay. Storymode doesn't appear to be available yet."

I was addicted from the start, and my gf and I didn't stop playing until we both survived til the end. It is a refreshing approach to the survival genre, and the added emotion makes it extra special. I'm looking forward to new releases from 11 Bit Studio. I've heard great things of their Anomaly series also."
