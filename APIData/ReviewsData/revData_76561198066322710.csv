2016-07-28,200210,True,realm is a great game but ksbsm just was letting it die doing nothing but now deca has hold of it its giving it a sort of life pot bringing the game back to the people who love it and the new players but i just have a couple things to say about the lag in this game: it ♥♥♥♥ing disjusting there needs to be more server (talking about Australia here) and also the way the game lags how everything pauses the spreds out the all bullets shoot at once could they make it if you ping was to high it would just kick you into the nexus so you dont loose you best character. but overall its a brillirent game and deca has really brang it back to life. also mabye add some more dungens
