2012-01-02,630,True,"An under-the-radar game. Alien Swarm is a F2P co-op top down shooter and guess what? There are ZERO micro-transactions and it's also made using the Source engine so it runs really well. You can play with 4 classes but there are 8 characters all with different stats. There are plenty of difficulty options and that gives the game quite some replayability, you can turn friendly fire on, you can increase the number of aliens and there are plenty more options. You should definitely give this game a try with 3 other friends."
