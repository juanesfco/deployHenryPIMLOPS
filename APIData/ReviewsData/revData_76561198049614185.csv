2014-02-27,236390,True,I think this game is worth playing becausNo.1 The graphics is so awesomeNo.2 you can play it on different devices (eg. Oculus Rift )No.3 It is so realistic No health bar It just depends on where you are shooting 
2014-12-31,244450,True,"Quite realistic i guessA lot of problems you need to care aboutlike munitions and stuff which would make you crazy so if you dont wanna care stuff like that I recommand you to buy CoH instead of this gameMost of the missions are like the samejust different nation, weapons , etc"

2015-08-02,50130,True,"Ups-Amazing story - Great gunplay- Great models - Great graphics- Great variety of guns and cars- Epic voice acting- Destructable environment for a Open world game- Realistic cops - Awesome and realistic driving mechanicsDowns- Story feels like it needs more work after the ending- No reason to explore any of the places- Lack of character , vehicles ,  customization - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ending - No side missions or side jobs- lack of clothing customization- Some of the features are useless after some 1 mission like the phone - No Ak-471/10 still a great game  - minus  6 because of there are no AK -47s"
