2016-03-11,304050,False,"Before i say anything i havent been playing this game on steam very much i have only really played it before it came out on steam.I would also like to thank trion for destroying my most loved mmo, and maybe even game.I have logged countless hours into this game with my friend and now they are adding too much.The thing i cant stand right now is the paid classes aspect.Before i would spend hours on end to get that one extra class.Now i have never put my money in to a game, and i dont plan on starting now.why trion?just why?"
