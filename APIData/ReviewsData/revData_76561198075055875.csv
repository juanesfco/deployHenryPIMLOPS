2015-05-01,204100,True,"The slow-mo in this game is really well done, its story is presented in a really nice way and getting to completely oblidarate with bullets is awesome. My only complaint would be the weird sensitivity. And you're in an area with little/no cover, have fun dying. A lot. I mean like, jump onto the ground repeatedly like an idiot to survive."
