2016-07-10,440,True,"Solid new update. Only problems: I can't play offline with bots (if this is a feature go back please I loved that mode), and the 'Find Game' button doesn't do anything! I tried sitting patiently, spam-clicking it, and all other manner of things and it refuses to give me a game. Moreover, I can't acess my server list. What is happening, and how do I fix it?"
