Ninja bunny with kick ♥♥♥ moves aswell as other animals, seemed like they had a cat as a mum and human as a dad, but not weird ♥♥♥♥ like tekken and dragon ballz ♥♥♥♥ im talking about like kick you opponent so hard in the ♥♥♥♥ with you hoofs that he goes flying onto the floor and die's slowly and jumping into the air and stomping the ♥♥♥♥ out of people's head then you kick them. You know what this game actually require's skill 'but you will learn grasshopper, (except jumping 100% off the time renders you invincible) ♥♥♥♥ing better then assasincreed parkour making the assainscreed look like its for mentally disabled people who can't press buttons' and you can do all this and its still alpha 'say whaaattttt?' yeah thats right but yourself a favor and get some, I mean ugh look at a tutorial for more fun download a parkour map and look at a tutorial for that.Oh and I almost forgot its got verus on the same CP so if you have 2 keyboards or 1 keyboard and 1 xbox controller or 2 xbox controllers then you can verus each other sick huh, anyways ask me you questions if you wanna know more or wanna get 2 free games when you buy this"
