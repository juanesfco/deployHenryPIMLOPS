H&G seemed a promising game, during the first few updates. However, the update that revamped the leveling system killed the game for me. This update completely reworked the amount point required for each rank and also poorly scaled the amount earned in battle. It seemed the game wanted me to be heavily reliant on its 'Pay2Win' system which involved spending lots to gain little progress.Though I disapprove of its scheme to make money, I like how the idea for WWII fps has been conveyed through this game. I still recommend this game as it is still only early access and the many flaws it still has can be ironed out, as there is still time until Reto-Moto finally release it. To the digression of those willing to download, be wary of the game's performance, I run decent specs and it is still laggy as hell. Also keep track of server maintenance as it can get annoying.10/10 - IGN, 'Would flip a tank again.'"
