LIKE EVERY COMICBOOK HERO GAME SHOULD!!!BUT...If you live in australia this game is nearly unplayable due to extremely high latency from the servers being soooo far away!If the makers of this game release an Asian, or even better an Ocianic server i can see myself playing hours and hours of this game and even throwing some of my money for useless things like costumes... :) So due to the aweful server locations i cannot reccomend this game to anyone in the Ocianic part of Earth. Chuck us a server then you'll get all the recommendations!!!!"
