If you buy this game, expect bad fps (even for typically good pc's, i'm running 6gb of ram and my overclocked cpu (running 4.0mghz), and i only run it on 'simple settings') and the occasional glitch in graphics and performance. If you can put up with that though, its an excellent game. The best way to look at it is like minecraft but more realistic, at least in vanilla mode. Personally I haven't tried any of the modded servers or the official servers because the reviews I've read about the online community disturb me a little, so I've stuck to small servers. If I had to give an honest review of this game, I'd have to put up two reviews. Once you get past the jumpy fps and occasional glitch, the game itself is solid as a rock. For the game I'd say 9.5/10, just need to iron out the wrinkles. As for the second review, (the community), while I have heard of bad players, the players that I have met online have been really good, so although not knowing what other players are like, I'd give the community rating at about a 7 or 8 out of 10, just to try and compensate for my lack of knowledge."

On the downside, respawn times are always annoying but are relatively easy to cope with. It's also a very time-consuming game, as one game alone lasts 90 minutes, give or take. Overall, a 9/10 rating from me. :D"
