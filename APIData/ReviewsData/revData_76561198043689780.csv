2016-06-02,236370,False,It was fun... Untill the devs did nothing... for a year and a half...
2014-08-03,221100,True,Beats the mod.
2016-05-18,281990,True,"pros:- very indepth- time accelerate for when thuff take too long- very usable HUD- looks pretty, runs great (and i mean high, 1080p on intergrated grpahics :)- game plays fluidly- loads of different playstyles, all promoting different things- multiplayer works surprisingly well (and up to 32 players :)- also with MP games you create are hosted on matchmaking servers, so no stupid port-forwarding.Cons:- sometimes AI is stupid / does things that don't make much sense- have to micro manage a bit too much (if a ship encounters an obticle it doesn't try to find a way around, it just sits there- combat is slightly luck based (enough to make me lose a couple of battles I really shouldn't have- nothing tactical involved with combat (no manouvers or anything to help, its just straight up stat vs stat)- the grpahics for battles look like an elaborate dance more than a battleOVERALL:I highly recommend this, its very fun and indepth. most of the cons I mentioned the devs have hinted that they would like to fix so no worries there."
2016-06-02,259700,False,The core concept is neat but it is so broken it took me over an hour to get a game with my friend and another 2 hours disconnecting and reconnecting... The game was just posted on steam and then never improved.
