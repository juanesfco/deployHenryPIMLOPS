2014-10-31,233740,True,"One of the greatest games to come along in a long time. Absulotely brilliant. I lost about 3 hours into it the first time, thinking I'd been on for like 10 mins."
2014-08-02,221100,True,DayZ is amazing now that it has been updated. And it's still in alpha.
2015-03-14,20500,True,"There's nothing more fun than driving through a building. A man takes on the world with a sledgehammer, one EDF building at a time."
2014-08-30,13570,True,"Probably the best stealth game out ther, along with Hitman: Absolution. Game looks incredible, and runs at 100 fps on a laptop, however resolution only goes up to 1280 x 766. Spies vs Mercs is the best game mode EVER! Get this game, and get it now."
2014-08-18,9480,True,"Saints Row 2 is the best game ever made. I cannot reccomend it enough, so if you don't have it, GET IT NOW."
