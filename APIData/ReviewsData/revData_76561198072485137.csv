2015-11-15,6060,True,"You can consider this as a positive review for this game and a negative for the new one.Quite possibly the best Star Wars game in the worldIt has everything: The characters, music, planets, guns, vehicles, space, and even mod support.Nothing is more rad than modding a game from back in the day. The only tragic part about this series/game, is that the 'Company' EA is making them from here on out. The new Battlefront is Multiplayer only, uses a loadout system, has ships and vehicles (you know, the part that made this game a classic?) as a power-up. There is no campaign, no Galactic Conquest, and FAR less planets than in even the first installment. Just stay with the classics (ie. this one) and ignore the new one until it actually has some content. EVEN THE DS GAME HAS MORE CONTENT THAN THE NEW ONE"

2015-08-11,38830,False,"Spent a hour and twenty minutes, suffering, just for a hat. This is a horrible abomination of what some call 'entertainment'.I assure you, this is not entertainment.This is something Jigsaw would put in a death trap.I would not want my worst enemy to play this.Playing this, I wonder if it was deveolped as a tourture device.Graphics are worst than PS1.Would rather get cancer than play again.10/10 better than Spiral Knights."
