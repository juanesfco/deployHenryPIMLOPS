I could only add that maybe progression doesn't always feel rewarding, however the will to push forward already established by players (at the start) should be enough.I thoroughly enjoy playing this game, worth the purchase in my eyes."

2014-07-16,239820,True,"This game is strangely addictive, its oddly fun simulation of a video game developing firm explores a world of technology, human resources and creativity. At times it can be smooth sailing and others, a challange to make a sucessfull game and smart business moves.It's worth every dollar."

I picked this game up out of the blue in a sale, only to be surprised by its wonderfully entertaining story, fun and challanging gameplay and interesting graphics. I only wish it was longer. A must play in my books."

It can however, get a little confusion/intimidatin but remains a overall fun game. Personal note: I found it more enjoyable using a controller, gave me a better feel for the game."
