2016-01-15,105600,True,Great game but do not buy unless its on sale. The devs of this game are greedy and only deserve sale prices. Put short if the game is anything more than 5 dollars at the time just wait until its on sale and help save your wallet. :DAs someone who has over 6000 hours in this game I can truly say it is awesomely fun and running a server for it is just the best way to experience the game with friends.There is also mod support for those interested in modding the game and making mods as well as a whole host of other game changing software that just keeps adding to the fun.I rate this game 11/10 just DO NOT buy it unless it is on sale. <3
