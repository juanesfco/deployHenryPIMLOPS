The game is non-linear, if you get stuck on something you can leave it for later and continue with the game elsewhere. This means you can avoid the frustration of not being able to progress, and makes for a relaxing and interesting experience. The sound design and sountrack is amazing, various different atmospheric soundscapes play, all with a trance like feel to them. The minimalistic surroundings work well in this game, using colours and shapes to guide you and distinguish different areas. As you progress you 'unlock' various metaphors and sayings which both tell several stories, as well as help you progress.The programming is incredibly well done and the 'Impossible Geometry' seen in art work is brought to life and utilised in creating a surreal experience. The controls are easy to use, and the game mechanics are incredibly unique. The only problems I encountered were due to my keyboard, and the innability I had to change key bindings, but this hardly affected gameplay. And if you want a game with a lot of replay value, this mightn't be the one. Before the game's end, you can return to places you've been and follow different routes to find new areas, however once you've solved a puzzle it's easy to do it again without much thought."
