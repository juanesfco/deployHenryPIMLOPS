Also, there's no tutorial, all you're told is 'here's a backpack, here's a leaf, collect tears (the players tears, mind you, because that's what this game wants from us, and oh boy, it has received)'."

I spent 40 minutes going in circles around the dungeon trying to find a character with directions, heh.anyway, a very good game for the price, doesn't take too long to beat (only took me 5 hrs) and I am hoping very much for a sequel. Also, if you enjoyed this, you might enjoy the labyronia rpg series, if you haven't already tried it, ty have fun :)"

2015-03-04,99910,True,"This is a highly strategic puzzle game, it has childish graphics, but isn't only for children. If you're a smart adolescent/adult that enjoys crushing the hopes and dreams of kids, then this game is for you. This is a skill-based game, where you can gain renown or infamy among the community. I highly recommend trying it out."
