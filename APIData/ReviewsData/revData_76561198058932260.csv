Yeah it was fun. 10/10 randomness. In one of the DLCs you can unlock a massive ball of yarn to drive down the street and cause mayhem."

2014-05-30,240,True,"One of my most played game purely because there is so much player made content that can be done such as surf, minigames and other assortments. There's always that little bit there that you want to strive to do better at."

2014-07-23,730,True,"If you have played any other Counter-Strike game welcome to CS:GO basically a re-skin of CS:S with some both minor and major changes. Such as the easy ability to do competitive match-ups, deathmatch and more. The ability to re-skin guns for money and open up cases with a skin chances of earning money. GLHF"
