2015-05-15,221100,False,"Bohemia m8, I r8 with h8 this game b8 0/8.Seriously though, stay away from this game. If anything, check out the mods, at least they are free, and just generally better. Epoch is quite good as you get fairly solid base building tools, vehicle modifications and random missions against bandits, mad scientists, heroes, and treasure hunters. Even with the best of PCs this game runs horribly. It's hard enough trying to survive in this game without your frame rate dropping to the point where you can't even aim to kill a zombie or player who is trying to kill you. Add to that the insane amount of cheaters and combat loggers and it is basically a death match, with random chances to die for no reason being extremely common (e.g. stand up in a house, die because the floor breaks your legs). Also, logging in and finding that a really nice piece of clothing or bullet proof vest you have has somehow become ruined (and thus damaging all of the gear in the clothing inventory slots) is common, and really frustrating. RIP plate carrier vest with gun pouch and Gorka military pants/jacket. May 2015 - May 2015, I crie evrytiem.I can't fathom why this game is priced so highly for early access, not when full release indie games (which can offer a much better experience) are usually lower in price. Elements that have been fixed for a long time in the mod (helicopter crashes, persistence, lack of loot) are suddenly broken in the standalone. Even new elements introduced into the standalone are broken later when something else is changed.This game might be more worthwhile when it is finished, but in its current state it is really not worth it. Avoid. It's like life, only @ 10FPS, with guns- IGN"
