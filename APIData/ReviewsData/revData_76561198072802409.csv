2014-03-01,48700,True,This game is awsome but with a few FlawesGood:Fun combatAround 10-20 good in depth mods like Roma Bellum and a total of around 200 mods (may be more)Lots of weapon choices Good Character custimizatonLots of orders that u can tell your men to doBest 'create your own army' game on the marketOpen worldGreat graphics if u play on full everything (need a descently strong computer) but if on medium everything up to par graphicLots of armor choicesUse mouse to direct hitsFun Castle seigesBadA little lag if u have over 150 people on screen dismounting horses is annoying u have to stop look at your horse and then press ENo campain for Napoleon DLC only Multiplayer (p.s. if you like shooting napoleon guns at real people in game its good)Overall and amazing game 19.99 i think is a bit over priced i think its worth 15.00 but stll a amazing game for its price (lucky i got it on sale)
