2016-05-24,391540,False,This game apparently has a charm that is lost on me.I didn't like the art styleI appreciated the combat/challenge aspect but i found it quickly became repetative.The story telling seemed good but the writers sense of humor wasnt for me.Unfortunatly after about an hour or so of play i didnt want to play any moreWell priced though
2015-05-16,245280,True,Its not bad.Story is what kept me playing.  The game play got old after about an hour of the same same.Got 5 or 6 hours out of the game though.I would say its worth $10  Its a shame that Sandy didn't make an appearance though. 6.5/10
