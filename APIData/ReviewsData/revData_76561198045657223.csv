2014-05-01,220240,True,"Whether you play for headshots, backstabs, gibbs or great stories, Far Cry 3 in particular provides a visceral experience for any player.Action FPS players will enjoy the outright havoc you can create on defended camps of pirates/mercenaries, loading yourself up with explosives and flame-throwers, not to mention flare-gunning gentleman to make your own screaming party-starter. This is balanced though with the option of stealthier play, going for a special-ops approach by sniping rim targets before dispatching with silenced SMG's, or perhaps opting for the full commando approach of bow and blade for silent and endlessly satisfying close up take-downs.When it does come to the combat, this is what makes the game shine; the freedom of choice and random environmental events that can make any replay completely individual. You can experiment with techniques and combinations that suit you and the situation until you hit your sweet spot, which for me is dispatching entire battalions without any of them seeing me coming, basically being Batman with camo paint.In regards to the adventure and story of the game, it's well written, thought provoking and at times legitimately scary in regards to the greatest evil out there; Ourselves. Delving into some beautiful psychological territory and being able to successfully portray their mentalities is what makes the characters of this game so engrossing and real. The character of Vaas is honestly the best portrayed character's i've encountered so far, the voice actor is brilliant, the animation and mannerisms support him so well you can't help but love him...you know, as much as you can love that sort of person.Admittedly the QTE's do cut into the freedom of the gameplay when it comes to 'boss fights' but it does allow for expression of the protagonist...it wouldn't be as insightful if you just popped them off from 100 yards and had a monologue explain how you felt about it. So as much as I don't like QTE's, these seem pretty  justified.Next is the environment, which is another of this game's strong points in all honestly. The 'world' is not vast but it isn't small either, and it really depends on how you choose to tackle it. Fast travel points allow you to quickly cross the map but you will miss out on all that randomly generated wildlife and firefighting, so depending on if you want to burn through the missions or really get right into the jungle, you're play-through will be quite different. I've included crafting, hunting and platforming missions in this section just to separate it from combat and narrative; the crafting is pretty fantastic, in that it's firstly a sort of tutorial for dealing with enemies without the risk of ranged damage, but if you are foolish enough to let most predators get close, especially in the early game, you're not going to live very long. This is so much more exciting than shooting at glorified paddlepop sticks and having a voice-over pat you incessantly for performing actions a child could accomplish. On the other point, platforming in this game can be repetitive at times but it's still always exciting, the slip and panic animations when you just make a ledge often causes a tight gripping of the mouse in response. The rewards at the end of these episodes are often worthwhile and you'll rarely feel cheated for that 5 minutes of leaping, ducking, climbing and diving.Possibly the biggest letdown to this game would be the multiplayer aspect. The lobbying can be aggravating and there isn't a large enough population on the servers to justify it being anywhere on par to other AAA FPS games. The Co-Op can be really fun and adds a whole new story to the world of FarCry, but as with the game as a whole, you'll need a PC that can handle it's graphic demands.Overall this game is a truly visceral and engaging experience if you can take on the character, if you can step into his shoes and let yourself live his story, you're gonna have a fantastic time. Be warned it's not for the fragile, there's a lot of gore, some nudity, drug references and references to social issues that you might not agree with, but they are used to engage and expand the characters for the most part.Game in a line:Wouldn't recommend to time-poor gamers, best played in-depth and with a willingness to be absorbed, after which will be a game nigh unforgettable.Get Into The Jungle!"
