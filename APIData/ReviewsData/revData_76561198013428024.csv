Storyline feels a bit more cohesive for BL2 vs BL1. Gaige and Kreig are fun for regular players to try something completely different in terms of their playing styles, but may be fustrating for people new to the game.Perfect for when you want to do a quick 1 or 2 hours gaming session with friends, dropping in and out of each others game is fairly fluid and straight forward."
