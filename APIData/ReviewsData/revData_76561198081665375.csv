No one should need a guide to finish this.+ Story is fascinating, occasionally suprisingly dark (Try taking a bit too long to solve some of the puzzles).- Game is too short. It took me only 3 hours to complete, getting all collectibles/achievements along the way.- Story is not substantial enough. A lot is hidden in the collectibles, but there still isn't enough to completely flesh out the universe. - Controls can be buggy. Occasionally you flicker in and out of the shadows while trying to manoeuver in the shadows.I'd recommend this game for the soundtrack alone. An entertaining game, though could have been a bit longer."
2014-07-30,280740,False,"The campaign is very short - too short really, although it had some fun levels in it. Some of the puzzles were very challenging, but the majority were too easy. Level design was excellent - I don't know why so many people are complaining about recycled levels. There really were'nt that many, and they were different enough to force you to rethink your approach.The paint gun model was disappointing, with no firing animation. You click the mouse, and a glob of paint is suddenly flying. The voice acting was actually quite good, however the lines were poorly written. Overall, an enjoyable mod. However I think it was overpriced for the amount and quality of content."
