2015-10-18,730,True,Im not gonna lie THIS GAME IS GREAT! and i have great respect towards it but some maps such as assult are very one sided :( terrorists have a great advantage and so many places to hid in the warehouse as counter terrorists have only the roof :( now i know the windows help CT's (counter terrorists) snipe some of the hideing T's (terroists) but then again its not as good of an advantage as the T's have. please fix this and make it more even thank you.

2016-02-01,222880,True,"great game but i hate 1 thing, you cant see who killed you. I realise it's ment to me realistic but still it's very annoying when for instence your a sniper, and out of no where you egt killed by some random player but you dont know who it was or what weapon they killed you with! i personaly think this is rediculous it would be nice if the creators could add this feature? im very sorry if this is needy ect. But i find it needed heavily, thank you kind regards Calz a fellow lover and player of insurgency."
