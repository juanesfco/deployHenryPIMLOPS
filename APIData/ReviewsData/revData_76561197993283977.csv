2015-08-26,257510,True,Simply amazing. At first you think it's a puzzle/maze game akin to Portal. But it has the richness of a storyline like Myst. You gain more knowledge about the world you're in as you progress through the game and you find you're stuck wanting to learn more. Very addicting. I'm pretty stupid and even I could work out most puzzles myself.
