It quite frankly sucks.Every mechanic in this game was stolen from larger more sucessful companies.This is one of the most disgusting excuses for a game i have ever seen, and i have played COD Ghosts0/10"

2014-03-15,12200,True,"Bully is GTA without the drugs, the sex, the deadly weapons or the murder. However, Bully is in its own right a great game. The minigames are fun and exciting and there is always something to do. The character, Jimmy Hopkins can be customized into the type of person you want him to be and no matter what choice you make the story will always look new and fresh. If you havent already, do yourself a favour and buy this game."
