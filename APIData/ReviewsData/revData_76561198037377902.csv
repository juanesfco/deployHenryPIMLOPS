2016-03-18,302510,True,"After turning om ACIP mode in Bois.It stoped my hardisk from crashing the game, allthough I had many minuites buffing and frezzing the game only to resume a few seconds later. Kind of ruinned the imersion. But none the less here is what i thought of it.bosses where a major chanage as there is no help online with understanding some of the fuction like RLB with Spacebar On the PC version  Confusing to use should RMB and SPace bar for shield instead it should of just been RMB IMOFPS was all over the place and massive slowdowns in much of the detailed areasNone the less it was fun and the story although half fictional and half history a good change some the standard same old hack and slash games.the grahpics where far beyond words it was really nice to the point of mind blowingAI is really smart (no dumb bots here guys/girls lol)It has to be the hardest games i ever played and always on egde.Completed  the game in 7 hours and very happy with the story IMONote: IDE Mode tends to crash the game."
