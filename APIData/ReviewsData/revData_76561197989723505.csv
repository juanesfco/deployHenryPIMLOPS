This is truly a well developed game by WRF studios, there are alot of room for improvements considering this only just got released and has alot of pontential. I am looking forward to what the developers have to do to make this game even better! :)"
2014-05-25,47890,False,"Sims 3 is a very poorly coded game, has alot of performance issues such as freezing, stuttering, fps drops even on a high end PC, and just feels outright sluggish and of poor performance. VERY POORLY CODED GAME. On top of taht EA has'nt even tried to patch these issues."
2016-07-21,208650,False,"Still has performance issues, so much for the so called patch to fix the problems, fps drops in bat mobile and gliding. Review wont change until its stabilized, until then."
2015-06-17,346110,False,"This game needs major attention, cant load into servers, cant play solo, cant load anything, changing memory options does not help, causes computer to freeze even though my comptuer has 8GB of ram and well over recommnded requirements, causes crashes, game becomes unresponsive, not responding, client error. Right now I regret buying this game. Opinion and review may change in future, when this game is fixed."
