2016-07-08,57300,True,"My Experience With Amensia : The Dark DescentIt's a fair game, plenty of scares. Not the cheap kind like jumpscares, actual terror.Once you figure out how to avoid monsters easily it's not as scary.All in all it's one of the best horror games I've seen.Make sure to play in the dark with a good set of headphones, for the best experience.Final Score9/10'OH P ISSING BLIMEY THERE'S JAM COMING OUT OF THE WALLSufeff' - Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw"
