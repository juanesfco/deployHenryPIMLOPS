2016-01-05,570,True,If you like team based strategy games. this is the ultimate version. if you prefer being a lone wolf. dont even download it. overall fun game. would reccomend it.
2015-12-30,304050,True,"Good Game, hours of fun, not really pay to win, more like pay to get better stuff faster.., pvp is okay.. some heroes are a little broken, overall id recommend it, my hours should prove i know a bit about the game, maxx lvl candy bard, lunar lancer and fae trickster."
