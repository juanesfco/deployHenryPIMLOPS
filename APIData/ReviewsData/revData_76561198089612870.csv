For a Free to Play game it's quite easy to advance without buying ♥♥♥♥, infact, I got myself an ATV, full set of decent armor, 2 pistols, ammo and pleanty of weapons, I even went on raids with some friends I met through a clan. Just thinking about all this makes me feel kind of sad, sad that I haven't played it in ages, and those firends have left, never to be seen again. The gameplay is pretty grindy, but advancing and getting better gear is very rewarding and the game world is ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE HOLY ♥♥♥♥, I once set out on my horse, travelled the lands for abut 3 hours straight, I ended up in some huge rusty old town, I have no clue if I will ever find the town I first set out in ever again. Infact, just writing this review makes me want to go play the game again actually I think I'll do that."
