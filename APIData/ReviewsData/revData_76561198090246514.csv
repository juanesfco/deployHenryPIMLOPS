A 10/10 in gaming but 2/10 for everyone else you have to play with online. If you go this game alone it will be difficult, but if you have friends who are willing to play it then by all means. Let the gaping black hole that is Dota 2 take you into an adventure that You will regret entering, but love playing. Ai in this game is very good for the scaling player, having easy, medium, hard and unfair as your difficulties. Once you can beat unfair bots you are ready to play online. At least that's what I suggest."
