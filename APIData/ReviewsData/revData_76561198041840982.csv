2016-08-16,275850,False,"This game has been an extremely big let down, to explain my point I will use a metaphor. Games are like pools, minecraft for example is 'infinite' and has enough depth you can put your head under while standing, and most AAA games are, quite deep and take you on an journeys regardless of how 'large' pool is. And to put plainly NMS is kiddy pool infinite in size. Extremely simple and impossible to do more then one or to things with. Although on its own this game would make good early access $30 game, but the slew of missing content raise more questions then answers we have ever got from the Hello Games dev team e.g Planets orbiting, ships class system, naming ships, flight control that isn't a form of dumb down auto pilot, the depth and complexity of the crafting and elements system. Now based on what versions of the games with have seen threw trailers and 'gameplay footage', it's looks as if the game has now become extremely simpler then the version we are playing now. Some reddititors have gone threw the footage from E3 and the likes, and have said that what we saw was very likely a real version of the game based some key artifacting that could of easily been removed in a pre baked animation e.g AA although this isn't 100% confirmed yet.This just my opinion, but it looks as if NMS has been effected by its need to run on the PS4, with the potential of Sony pulling strings forcing Hello games making the game simple to reach wider audiences and there for more buyers.With all this in mind it is best to hold on to that $60 USD till one of these things happen:1. They update the game bringing it closer to the E3 versions and promises made.2. They reduce the price, justifying the content or lack there of.3. A better and cheaper game that is similar comes out"
