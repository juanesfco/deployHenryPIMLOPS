2015-02-15,251150,True,"On my fourth play through at the moment looking for some elusive achievements along with just plain enjoying it still. I loved the story and characters, the constant reading of text can get rather tedious especially in longer cut scenes but after the first play through I remember what they say anyway so I just hold down skip. Arts and orbments were a little confusing at first but you get the hang of them quickly enough. Battle can be rather repetitive after a while, luckily after levelling up a bit you get certain attacks that can decimate large groups of enemies (Black Fang, Howling Bullet, etc) but you need CP charged up but that doesn't take too long. Basically, if you are a fan of the genre, or looking to get into the genre, you should love this game. I simply cannot wait for Second Chapter to come out."
