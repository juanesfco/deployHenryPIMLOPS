2014-12-25,206420,True,"I didn't get it the first time I played Saints Row 4, very whacky and a rather bizzare story. A few weeks ago though, I found the first three on sale and decided to get them. Having more context to the characters gave it some clarity and helped me understand what was going on. I'd recommend anyone who hasn't to at least take a brief look at the characters origins.For the game proper, it's an interesting mix of open world mayhem with a lot of destruction and some crazy superpowers. Although the story starts well, the tedious and long introduction to the world gets a bit annoying, but as the game progresses the missions get even weirder and pretty funny. Fight a giant soft drink mascot with a national monument!As I said though, the context of the missions is very bizzare and often will make absolutely no sense if you haven't played or at least read up on the previous games. I'd recommend this game to pretty much anyone with the time and money to play the previous games, but for those who don't it's still good."
