2014-10-06,317110,True,"So to start this game you pick a destination to begin you're journey.There are six location's such as spain,london and some other really nice tropical places I forgot there names xD. I picked London because it looked like a ♥♥♥♥ hole compared to the others and I want the feeling of looking foward to going to a nice bohama island in the future of playing this game. When i started playing this game around say 50 minutes ago I had no clue what to do and still very much the same but that will soon vanish. The gameplay to this is very complex, reminds me far to much of everquest gameplay. Every little tiny bit of content just seems to carry more content and complexity and I love that! It feels like you achieve somthing everytime you complete a new task or a new skill!There is no auction house :'( which is the only dissapointment I have atm, but as suffisicated as this game is they make you the auction house! You must bargain with other player, sell your good's and make an absolute fortune or even make your self titled as king merchent.The graphics are nice :) The content is insane! I have been told there are easily over 500 ships in this game and each one can be designed by you! With over 1000 decoration pieces it seems rare to spot a twin of you're ship :'). I allways spot people wearing different clothing and different weapons. Its rare to spot someone looking the same as someone else. Unless of coure you are a noob liek me and are still wearing you're student uniform :p.The world map is our world map. The uncharted waters page on steam simply states there are over 180 locations to be explored including the entire ocean. Last of all the community! I have not been in a kinder comunity ever! as soon as i hopped on world chat I was warned about certain people camping at certain spots waiting to kill other people. But hey I was told by a group of people that they would protect me! and help me out if i ever get attacked and one of my new friends said if i ever want a player killed that i should tell him ;). Soi yes in under an hour I have now made two new friends :S. I was also offered one million dollars from each player I was talking to in the world chat <3.I cant wait to explore and venture forth through out this game even more! So far I absolutely love it!10/10Great gameplay, Awesome amount of content!"
2014-07-10,241720,True,"Guncraft.Guncraft reminds me alot like Ace of Spades but only gubcraft has seen the content in ace of spades, and they used that content (Not all of it) and they created there own game. Gun Craft includes numerouse modes like lava survival, Meteorite survival, TDM. FFA etc. Also come with its own customisation tool which is probably the highlight of this game.Otherwise this game lacks in fun.TDM: Its lame! Probably doesnt help when there are no one on servers any more :p, you just run around shoot be shot and then killed feels like COD, but strangely less fun than COD. O-O.Meteorite survival: I acctually liked this one, allthough yet again all servers are dead and the most amount of people I played with was two, the other guy and I.Lava survival: The lava takes a full Ten Minutes to rise to the top, and with all the helicopters and some hover bikes offered right away in lava survival it isnt that hard to get access to high places. When everyone is at a high place you can shoot them but not kill them, they only turn into snow men, once a snowman you shall not move for seven seconds and immediately after yur turn from being a snowman back into a human you're apponent is allowed to shoot and kill you again 2 seconds afterwards, then you are a snow man again for another seven seconds! And yes they can continue to do this >:(. So that sums lava survival up for you, get to a high place turn each other into snowmen for ten minutes, once lava rises close build two blocks higher to survive like what the other person did aswell lava rises to the max. Boom! Both of you have had a Draw YAY!What else do I need to talk about?!?! Oh yes the build tool!The build tool consist of you running away from enemy urgently wanting to get out of fire, you must press B then you are given blocks and you can build you're escape, but wait you want to do some moe damage to the opponent so you have to switch from build mode back to attack mode. Then you;re health is low so you want to escape again so you continue a exceedingly slow build! After you place one block you must wait a unecessary 3 seconds ?! By now you have allready been killed, if only the building was faster and you didnt have to switch from build mode to kill mode in the middle of a shoot out, as this is very frustrating.Dont even get me started on the grapple which gets you Fing nowhere!Overall I have had two fun games, a sequall would be cool, if they improved the features.I rate this game a 4/10, it was worth the summer sale price :D"
2014-03-05,239220,True,"The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot, is a grand hack and slash, humourous birds eye view ftp game with plenty of potential to come in with further updates (Its a beta). My honest opinion of the game.The combat is superb and the skills look magnificent, especially playing as the mage, the magic looks awesome!The Graphics are nice, although sometimes Dull. It can sometimes feel the same thing over and over again with nothing unique to make it feel different, apart from a few new enemie types.Is it really a quest for loot? In my opinion not really unless you are continueousley searching for gold, or the life crystals. There is barely any gear whats so ever, unlike the torchlight series or titan quest. On the very first castle raid I found the same mage cuff (Glove) five times! and one or two different staff's and a piece of clothing. And you will find the same items for that region :(. It is only in beta I understand hopefully they do bring out more gear :D.You get to customize your own castle which I think is epic and the tutorial is so simple making it very east to understand :D.Classes you either get a Mage,Archer,Warrior and some barbarian chick, they all look cool and I wish to play as them all ! But unfortunately to make a new class you have to pay for it in real money WTF!! I honestly have never played a game that made you do this, and teh items in the shop reach to $30 per bundle offering so little! Its unfortunate :(.Over all a really fun game and quite enjoyable, allthogh it does have its cons but HEY what free to play game doesnt make you pay now?7/10GOOD GAME!"
2014-01-30,70,True,"Half life is an absolute classic, and brings back fun/annoying and very gorey memories from playing at a younger age.Still a fave.10/10"
2014-05-16,265630,False,"To be honest I really enjoyed the layout of this whole entire game, Its like a western css, csgo,The graphics are really well textured and the scenary is really nice especiall that snow level. What I do intensley dislikeabout this game is the aiming system, I went behind a guy with my revolver 45 ping! No lag running smooth. I then shot him in the back of the head with the crosshair right on his head and some how I missed, he then turned around as he heard my three gun shots, and he threw a knife at me direct hit and killed me?Sometimes I dont understand this game at all :p. Aim system needs to be fixed even if it is realistic, i dont care it needs to be fixed.Overall,6.5/10Its just ok, from me :p"
2014-02-07,253430,True,The sound track is pretty cool.:)
2013-12-13,265210,True,"So santas fed up with greedy little children asking for to much, so he has a meltdown and takes it all out on his elfs by brutaly murdering them. That sums up the whole story. So your job is to be a clean up elf, or a human I dont know which one you play as. Pretty much you are armed with your hands, a mop, and a digital remote which no one know's what it acctually does.Thats it you just clean up the blood and make the workshop tidy again, now as lame as it all sounds it is acctually quite an enjoyable game with pretty nice graphics and a few difficult obstacles like TNT.Cant go wrong, it was under 2 dollars.Best christman game I have ever played."
