2015-05-08,730,True,"CS:GO is a fantastic reboot to the classic Counter-Strike series. It's not just a repackaging with spangly new graphics - a lot of the game has been reworked so that it gives a great introduction to new players and returning CS veterans. Additional features include a training mission, customisable weapon loadouts (slightly reminiscent of Team Fortress 2), and the excellent Deathmatch gamemode that lets you play with any and all of the weapons as you run around the map and enjoy a neverending all-out guns-blazing brawl!CS:GO lets the Counter-Strike franchise live up to its name as the greatest competitive first-person-shooter with an all new freshness. Go play it, and shoot some terrorists in the face!!"
2015-05-08,235460,True,"MGR:R is a game where you slice giant robot mechs in half with an electric samurai sword. It also has one of the best soundtracks in gaming history that I still listen to months after finishing the game. There is a steep difficulty curve with learning the controls and that god-forsaken parry mechanic, and the game's length does not give you sufficient time to master the mechanics in one playthrough. You'll probably spend that time getting your butt whooped.However, the game invites you to play it multiple times, as there are multiple difficulty settings, challenge missions, a variety of gadgets, weapons and instruments of death and dismemberment at your disposal, allowing for a variety of playstyles and present a number of different solutions for the stealth segments. Yes, there are stealth segments. But when you can dispatch a whole bunch of cyber-mooks and reduce them all to iron filings without taking damage, you will feel like an angel of death.The writing is a little cringe-worthy and cutscenes drag on like you're watching an anime, and in the true anime style, the tone jumps from dark and serious to awkward attempts of being comedic, to over-the-top and dramatic, but I can forgive it, as the storytelling still holds my interest, has a memorable cast of characters and the MGR:R experience as a whole is just really, really fun. In fact it might be the most awesomely ridiculous, nuts-out, explosive fun that has ever come from the AAA industry lately. I'm 200% glad I bought this game."
2014-11-08,234390,True,"Teleglitch is a beautful game. No, really. Sure, you can count the number of pixels your character is made up of, but the simple, low-res style is compensated for by great lighting effects and clever use of line-of-sight, as well as a sense of nostalgia, mostly of DOS games. With it's top down shooter style reminiscent of Flash games, simple and intuitive controls and inventory and crafting system, the game world itself carries a highly atmospheric setting and a compelling story that you unlock piece by piece at computer terminals ingame. There's a great amount of tension and uncertainty as you shoot, salvage, sort your items and ultimately try to survive, unsure of how long you're going to last. The gameplay is very challenging but not overly unfair, and satisfying from the very start.Not a lot of roguelikes catch my interest but Teleglitch creates a gameplay experience that always stays fresh. Hats off to the developers, they've made an awesome game, and an awesome experience."
