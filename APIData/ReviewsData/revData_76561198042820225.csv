2014-02-21,207650,True,"fun and addictive. Play as a cute little computer virus and hack stuff, watch out for anti-viruses, oh and theres co-op."
2014-03-21,204360,True,"Fun. Varied. Unexpected stuff happens. Castle Crashers is a 1-4 player co-op side scrolling Beat-em-Up with a unique sense of humor and a great vectorised art-style. Best played local with friends (Seriously play with friends it's worth it) and also fun playing with friends online (with a mic or steam chat). No two levels are the same, the combat and gameplay is always changed due to new situations/bosses/enemy types/weapons. You can fight jedi knights. They are literal knights with lightsabers. YOU CAN PICK UP THEIR LIGHTSABERS!"
