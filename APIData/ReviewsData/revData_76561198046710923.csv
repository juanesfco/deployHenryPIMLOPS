2016-06-11,356670,True,by the time i had gotten this game i had already seen multipul playthroughs of the game. I thought i knew what i was getting myself into.... I was wrongand now i have a very expensive carpet cleaning bill just to get all the excrement out of my floors. 10/10
2015-02-15,236430,True,in this game you play as a leper with super stregth  with the ability to looks at bundles of twigs to forget how disfiigured and disgusting you actually look..untill you die needs more realism like falling off arms and legs like a real leper victim you should buy this game to help raise awareness on how hard it is to be a Leper  you can also crush boxes and destroy walls with your sword so thats pretty boss

2016-05-31,200510,True,i spent hours making the closest to the real thing look alikes of all my friendsonly to watch them die in minutes. now i dont have to be passve aggressive to my friends because i can just get them killed by doing stupid  ...like running one tile from an enemy and pulling the pin on a grenade if you have issues with people i suggest playing this game.   also its a really good game or whatever
