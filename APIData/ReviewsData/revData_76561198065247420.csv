2015-04-08,239800,True,"It's a hard (HAH I SAID HARD) game once you start, but once you get over the factor of it being quite hard (HAH I SAID IT AGAIN), it becomes really fun. You'll have multiple rages and at some point I thought I ♥♥♥♥ myself just from dying.8/10 would fap again."
2015-02-21,304930,True,"It is fun, but i find that it is hard at the start only because it is hard to fight zombies with your bare fists. So essentially what I am trying to say is, it only becomes fun up until you finally get some stuff in your inventory."
2015-01-30,219150,True,"This is a great game.I love how gory and how violent the game is.The only bad thing I can say about this, is it doesn't make it clear how they get the protagonist to commit these crimes.What I also love is how they added an extra feature at the end. I won't say what it is incase people would consider it to be a spoiler.This game is not for the faint of heart and above all CHILDREN.Everyone should play this game when they get the chance."
