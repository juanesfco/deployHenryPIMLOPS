The sheer size of the New York City hub, combined with such a large roster of playable characters just make running around smashing or racing fun. Definitely recommended."

2016-01-12,342200,True,"The latest PC game incarnation of the classic BattleTech simulator series, MechWarrior Online offers a unique gameplay experience for a nominal F2P shooter game, slower paced and more tactical. There are few things greater than piloting a BattleMech stomping across the battlefield to slug it out with other 'Mechs."
