As an RPG game lover, I love the elements implemented into it with a mixture of Pokemon (more like the sense of Pokemon). Its soundtrack is great, its story is expandable to three different endings, and it will fill you DETERMINATION."

This is the most-liked gamed on Steam, and if dare try to find a bad review, you should go home and rethink your life. P.S. - You will find a 'ball of iron and a vegetable.'"
