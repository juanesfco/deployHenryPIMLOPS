Or get in and out without the cops even knowing you were there? it all depends on your team and skill, but even the smallest mistake such as not answering a guards pager can mess your plan up entirely. With a vast range of weapons, customizable masks, Body  armours and gear, this game is definitely worth trying if you enjoy intense gun fights and smash and grab scenarios."
