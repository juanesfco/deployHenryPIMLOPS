I had $2.48, I saw this game. I bought it.And am I glad I did, this game plays a lot like Metroid, the music is beautifully synthesised and the graphics take me way back."
2015-10-10,243470,True,"Out of all the games I have played, this game is the best.. Having it's wide variety of characters and citizens with their own unique traits. Aiden himself is also unique, as you slowly learn about his backstory. The gameplay is great, with it's big city, and multiple gaming mechanics, especially the hacking mechanic.I would totally recommend this game :)"

2013-08-16,440,True,"Team Fortress 2 is a class based FPS shooter with you controlling how you play, there are many weapons and helpful things (like hats) that can help you on your journey for justice! (another match).This game is packed full of new content either nerfing weapons or adding new ones (some are crappy).The vairiety of classes can be seen as a small number but how you play them can control hundreds!TF2 also occasionally has traditions as 'Smissmas' and 'Halloween'. In these occasionall treats you can gain new items and fun maps. But who am I to count, you can play them all! (maybe...idk).TF2 has a unique charming cartoony style, with it's sorta CEL shaded graphics.I really liked this game ;)Good job Valve.You made a monstrosity of overpowered Pyros and Snipers. Now welcome to Hell everybody!"
