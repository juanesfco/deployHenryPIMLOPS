The game has been running very smoothly at a consistent 60fps with max settings on my gtx 970 and I haven't had a single major fps drop or bug or really anything. The only thing I've had trouble with for this title is the key mapping, for whatever reason I just couldn't get it running optimally, mainly during battles but this was easily remedied by simply using a controller instead.Fantastic port, would recommend."
