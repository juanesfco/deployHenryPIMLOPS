The bugs in this game can be moderately bad to scare-the-living-daylights-out-of-you by teleporting zombies on you and them being able to walk through walls. I think in this game there should be a few more things to do, because now there are a lot more options such as cooking and such but otherwise it gets very lonely in the game. Random towns and areas that contain absolutely nothing are very disappointing and the noises of wire fences rattling and zombie moans can give you a heart attack. Given the fact that this game is Alpha and there are a lot of bugs that need to be fixed to be able to play it with a lot of fun and enjoyment, it is a very good game and the set up of the towns and other villages etc are good for a game that you want to spend hours upon hours on. If you like running on a game for half an hour in reality to get to an airbase that you could get killed at and have to do it all over again, and lose your stuff, then this is the game for you."
