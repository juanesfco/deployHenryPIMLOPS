2014-07-07,295730,True,"This is a short review of this game. I touch areas minimally, and this is mostly an opinion.For a game that seemed so simple on the outside, It's great. It's a beautifully made game about running in and shooting the hell out of anything that moves. The graphics are well done, the mechanics are nice, the sound in this game is catchy and enjoyable, and offers a challenge to overcome the barrages of bullets and enemies. This game is great and all, However there are things that I don't like. I happen to be a person who likes to 100% games with achievements and all, and having to go back and forth through multiple areas multiple times just gets painful. I forget that I am indeed able to die, and just run through like I'm god, forgetting about my gun and shield. I have also found a few glitches here and there. Once, I was able to go on the water at the beginning, before I had the ability to, accessing an area I shouldn't have been able to otherwise. I also managed to get myself glitched in the wall at the third boss. Not able to die, teleport or go back, I had the reset, doing the entire place again as well as the boss. That ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off a lot.Overall, this game is still great, the music and graphics are colourful, and the game mechanics are nice. There are minor annoyances, but they aren't game breaking."
