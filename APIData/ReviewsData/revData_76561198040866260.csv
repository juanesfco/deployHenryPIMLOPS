2016-08-17,211820,True,Love it so far!PROs:                   CONs:-free build             -mini missions get annoying (but theyre optional)-no handholding-immersive OST-Doesn't take itself seriously -Boss fights are actually hard and intense-weapons do not feel over or under powered-easy to lose 5 hours and not realise it -Can create your Base HQ on any planet -Main story seems intersting so farIn summery: i cannot beleive a game built around 8-bit graphics has me so immersed(Sucks to be No Mans Sky)
