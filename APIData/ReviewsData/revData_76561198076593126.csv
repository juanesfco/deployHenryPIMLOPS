2014-04-08,110800,False,Words of advice: if you hate lag in video games get this game on a console. there is so much lag on the pc version it was almost irritating to play.

2014-02-02,208090,True,"Be ready to get all OJ Simpson up in here because this game is VERY violent. This game is a fast-paced 3rd person shooter so this game genre has been done to death what could this game possibly have to offer? Limetless weapon customisation, Yeah thats great what else? Make your own classes, and its free. In my personal opinion i thought that loadout was better than TF2. You need to try it. WARNING!! Its very addictive!"
