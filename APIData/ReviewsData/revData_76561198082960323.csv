2014-07-03,4000,True,"For a game that has sold 6 million copies (as of 17 Sept 2014), Gmod still continues to have glitches, errors and map mishaps causing joining friends' servers to become more torturous than need be.Yes, one CAN go read forums for solutions to problems and issues. However, when problems keep continuously happening over and over again, one tires of spending the majority of their time on the game frustratedly trying to fix the game instead of actually playing it.Although, in those rare moments that the game manages to load properly for everyone playing together, it is an immensely enjoyable game to play with friends. At first I recommended it to everyone, however, the more people I played with, the more problems (that could be fixed easily by updates) seemed to arise. Maps, content or textures that people had already owned would not register when they tried to play the game and either resulted in the person not being able to join the server at all (wouldn't even let them download the missing items from the workshop), or joining a server with huge error signs and checkers causing massive lag.10/10 for fun and entertainment, 0/10 for ease of playing. Please, fix this awesome game."
