2016-07-22,375910,False,"In short, this game is an overall disappointment, especially for long time players.It has no replay value and is not worth the price. It has no soul, replayability or drive. Without anykind of real challenge apart from making you wait. Where is the skill in that?The economy managment is dead boring and each replay is essentailly the same game. This game needed the randomised and variety of games possible that we saw in Anno 1404 and 2070. However the developers were to lazy to even design new models of building/vehicles we saw in 2070. Basically this game is a dissapointing blue tinted mess, that is sponging of previous work and does not care for any kind of value for money or player satisfaction.Do Not Buy This Game."
2015-05-08,264710,True,Subnautica is not your average survival game. It uses inuitive controls and stunning graphics to create a truly beautiful alien underwater world. The best part of subnautica is just exploring the depths and entcountering the wide array of animals and plants. Its a promissing game with a focus on exploration rather than weapons or killing creatures. Get subnautica and you wont be disapointed!
2014-06-21,220200,True,Kerbal Space Program is quite possibly the best simulator of space flight and planetary exploration out there. Not only does this game allow for hours of experimentation but is increadibly easy mod to expand your physics simulation experience. Have fun renacting NASA as you visit the moon and reach for the stars in your interplanetary vehicle as you lead your little Kerbonauts to victory.
