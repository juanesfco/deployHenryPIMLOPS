2016-01-21,305960,False,Let me start off by saying this game holds a ♥♥♥♥ load of potential. I've been a part of it for a couple years now and the lack of improvement is just sad. The game has so many bugs and errors atm that I can barely play it.Very dissapointed at the devolopers.
2015-05-05,233860,True,Have had this game for a long time now and I still hold a lot of hope for it.... The progression in it's development has been disgustingly slow however.... I recommend keeping an eye on this game... As of right now it's fun to play but lacking....
