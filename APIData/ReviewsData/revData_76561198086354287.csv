2016-09-01,226880,True,"Epic DLC,Had alot of fun with this,close to Dawnguard in my opinion. Epic new shouts include:Cyclone-(Fus Ro Da with a *TWIST*) Dragon Aspect-(Become a walking Dragon)Bend Will-(Rock Smasher,Mind Breaker and Dovah Conquerer)            [Might be more but I forgot]Worth checking out if you've got nothing to do since main quest ended and/or Dawnguard stuff finished."
