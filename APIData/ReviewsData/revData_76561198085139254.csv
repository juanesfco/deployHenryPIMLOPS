2016-05-12,6980,False,Game is bugged. Trying to click doors with locks just locks my view on the for a bit and then resumes as normal in a second. Can't even get past tutorial
2016-08-20,201810,False,Very surprised by the positive response to this game. Heavy stuttering despite the absolutely horrible graphics. Textures are bland and of low quality.Sound design is nothing special.Gunplay is also bland and unsatisfying. The guns feel like they have no weight to them.
