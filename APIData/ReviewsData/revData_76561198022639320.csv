2015-12-20,296970,True,A lighthearted rogue-lite turn based tactic game. It's very good at what it does and with a simple yet deep rock paper scissors combat. It has excellent replayability thanks to the different approaches and play styles you can try. I'd recommend it to anyone into strategy games.

2014-06-30,225080,True,"An interesting game. No UI, not a single word in English, super simple controls, and yet, it tells a really good story about the struggle of 2 brothers (lel) in a fantasy world. I strongly recommend this game for anyone looking for a game with a emmersive story with some puzzle platforming. 10/10."
