2014-05-09,51100,False,"i Saw the Games Ad and Thought, 'Looks Great, Plus i am Bored, Lets Give it a try' Once a Downloadad the Game, i was lagging, the loading screen took WAY To long, the Animations were ♥♥♥♥, the Player Models were Plain. Its just a bad remake of Counter-Strike. i Dont think i want to play it anymore. i mean, they hardly even worked on the gun models for this game. But, The fact you can ride in cars and take hostages as sheilds is pretty cool, other then that the game is just like a better version of COD."
