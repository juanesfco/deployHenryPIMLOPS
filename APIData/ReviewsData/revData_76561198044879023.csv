2015-02-04,11590,True,"10 hours to complete start to finish , it was pretty entertaining with a storyline of very little consequince.Even though this has a better graphics it does lack the enjoyment and thought put into theme hospital.Would like to see a sequel or dlc"
2015-01-29,298110,True,"So this is what the ac black flag team been doing.This game I got immersed in right of the bat , exploring every corner to hunt game to upgrade my gear , the missions are very diverse and I feel immersed in what ever I am doing at the time , the politics and tensions do play a nice role but it is kind of a bummer --spoiler alert-- but nothing you do seem to change the situation for anyone in the country regardless of who's ideals you follow, at the end you feel like the country would be better off if you simply stayed in the room where Pagin told you to stay. - I do hope this gets addressed in  future dlc's But the ride was fun and incredibly detailed even the side quest into shangri la was awesome!!!! For the bad - Taking towers is easy (with a buzzer you can practically do anything)Taking bases are easy - especialy once you get the sniper rifleTaking strongholds - Easy I found some outposts harder to knock downSide-quests should be disabled when you are trying to take a base, I am sick and tired of a hostage taking dumb@ss running into me revealing my position Good game and the only thing that made my AC unity purchase worth while"

2014-11-20,289650,True,"After some thought I am changing my review but there is method to my madness so please note.The bad1. At launch this game was buggy as hell and I hope ubisoft learned that is better to delay a release (or beta first) rather than release an inferior product - 2. Never underestimate the intelligence of your audience , they will find out about your review embargo3. Never Ever ever put in-app-pruchases in a AA title it is very bad taste , and makes fans weary for the time they can only complete the game after buying another $100 worth of stuff on a game they already spent $80 on.4. They did make it a bit more challenging but please note the ability to dodge(hand shield) a ranged attack is needed5. The gameplay is mind numbingly repetitive ,parkour to waypoint, sneak/smoke bomb, kill done rinse repeat, the investigation thing is a bit nice but also very predictable and can usually be solved by looking at the first 2 clues6. Health potions , Now armed with 2 smokebombs and filled up on health potions you can take down a battalion with zero to no effort ( what ever happened to running)7. Smoke bombs mid battle used to be easy , now since patch 3 I become a pincushion when trying to smokebomb .The good 1. Huge open world2. Challenging fights (occasionally)3. Good Story line (Black flag was excellent), this is a bit predictable 4. Stunning visuals ( making my quad core high spec pc work for the money I spent on it)Since Update 31. Crashes are fewer and far between ,2. Having some trouble jumping out of some windows from inside the building. collisions problems3. Sometimes blocking attacks will not block at the point of attack (example she sparks will fly on the left where the enemy attacked from the right.4.  crowd seem smarter but some folks are still doing a 1 meter drop especially when i start to run.If you wish to play Assassins Creed and don't have black flag rather buy black flag its far better value if you want to purchase this game rather wait for the price to drop to $20 , the only reason why I see value is because i got season pass and ubisoft gave a free game (farcry 4) with it and a free dlc."
2014-10-29,72850,True,"Love this game everything about it keep the same level of exciting gameplay Oblivion provided and the modability makes it a worthwile investment , along with 2 stunning dlc's (because les be honest heartfire is ok but there are better 3rd party mods out there) --ESO Rant----Playing this also brings me great agony over the Elderscrolls Online release, I am sure this direction was taken by some who did not truly appriicate the last 3 releases. Zenimax online took a major dump on this title by making you share a somewhat finite space with a whole bunch of players trying to do exactly what you do is redicilous , and nikel and diming us for a game that could have been bought once now having to fork out $180 a year excluding the retail cost of the game. I am not saying dont go multiplayer (Co Op option maybe) but going MMO is really detriment to the spirit of the game (as well as going to the time of the aldmeri invasion of Cyrodil is kind of a buzzkill as Skyrims events take place after that). The game is ruined by something that no one asked for just to build a cash cow--How to fix it---Go Forward to where the empire fights back the now corrupted aldemri dominion, create dlc's that opens up the entire Tamriel, embue the feel of being the one centrepoint of heroism in the world.Skyrim I would recommend 10 out of 5 :)But hold on to your cash when going for ESO, if you are a die hard Elder Scrolls fan you will be greatly dissapointed"
2014-09-27,45700,True,Its DMC 3 with new storyline and characters and waaay easier bosses.STill good old fasion button bashing fun.Level design a bit impractical and clunky .Find the person that pitched the idea of the motobike throttle for the sword handle and make sure he/she excluded from future brain storming sessions.
2014-03-21,213670,True,"Power Points:Would I do it all again : YES Woudl I get the dlc if one ever gets released : you betcha !Woudl I recommend someone who does not know South Park to get it , NO , trust me you will be p-d off , watch at least the first 10 deasons and then decide.Best thing about it : Its South Park in every wayWorst thing about it : Cost -Spoiler warning--16 Hours in I completed the main quest along with all side quests and spent 30 minutes trying to figure out where kevin's Ipad is and how to get past the rats at the entry of the forest. Trying to get to the crab people , just to find out I need a skill first.I enjoyed the game though I think someone who is not a fan of South park may not get all the jokes and references , it is cleverly coded and very bug free , I only encountered one bug when trying to disarm the snuke. other than that everything ran smoothly. In summarry this game brings everything you would come to expect in an epic south park episode. the game balance is very good and I never got to a point where i was stuck for 3 hours trying to find some stupid key or fighting a boss, and found Al Gore the most challenging. With an edequate mix of gross , saturical and down right funny as hell humor this is a must have for south park fans. the levels are cleverly designed and you can truly see that the series production team worked closely with the game developers on this oneCost wise I think this game leans on the more expensive side in terms of content quests and player customization. and that it only kept me entertained for 16 hours"
2014-03-05,230190,True,"After flip floping my optinion on this game many time I have settled on I would definitely recommend this gameEven though I agree this game could use some work I am very glad to see the team working hard to make this work 100% , and not just launch the title and abandon the game .With every patch I become certain these guys love the original DK as much as I do maybe even more.What would make me do a backflip from happyness is if you guys can make the imps level up"
