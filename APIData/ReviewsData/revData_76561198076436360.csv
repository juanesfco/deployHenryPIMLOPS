2013-12-10,253770,True,"This Review is Purely my opinion,This game is based in Germany in 2012 as you, the bus driver, it may be boring for some people who like to rush through games, However i will recommend this game to people who would like to roleplay being a bus driver.In Bus Simulator 2012 there is no ending to it, as it is a game that has unlimited missions in it.  This game is as shown $9.99 & if you buy this game & not like it well it is not the end of the world as it is a reasonably good buget priced game.There are though the odd couple of bugs & glitches that may force you to restart the game, but they are quite rare & you will often play the game without experiencing any stuff ups."

2013-08-07,35450,True,"This is the best game that i have ever played, Thus far.  Really realistic with Balistics for bullets, 1st person Tank gameplay, but sadly there was no Anti-Tanks cannons (Pak 34 for Germans) like on Red Orchestra Ostfront 41-45.A must have for any historian, ballistics student or just to 'every man and his dog'"
