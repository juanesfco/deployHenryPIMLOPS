2014-11-14,48700,True,"Really really fun and immersive game, gotta love the punishments you get when you make dumb descisions like trying to win a fight with an overpowered group of bandits and being captured by them if you're not strong enough. Really recommend this to anyone who loved Dark Souls or Oblivion"
