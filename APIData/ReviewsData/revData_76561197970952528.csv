2015-08-07,304650,True,"Sunless Sea is a wonderful 'slow burning' game.  On the surface it appears as another Rogue-like game where you are punished incessantly for non-perfect play, yet when you break that initial surface, much like entering the Unterzee (where you will be spending your time), the game reveals this beautiful tapestry of tension, poetry, imagery and unease.Sunless Sea is related to the web-browser game Fallen London and you can reference Fallen London for back story of the Unterzee (or visit the Sunless Sea wiki - though that can be quite heavy on spoiler material, especially for intrepid Zee Captains out there).   It has a very Lovecraftian feel to it with all the hints of deep horrors, madness and surrealistic encounters.  For those who enjoy the weird-horror genre you will more than likely greatly enjoy what is on offer here storywise.The game is very text heavy and you will be reading a great deal, if you don't like reading in games, this may well be a big hurdle for you to surmount.  The writing is wonderfully superb though sublimely poetic and entrancing.  It gives off a great Victorian era feel, albeit with that Cthulhu-esque twist to it all.You begin your Unterzee journey as a Zee Captain out of Fallen London (London that was stolen and relocated to the shores of the Unterzee).  You start off with a small sailing vessel, rudimentary weaponry and a crew of faceless sailors.  You will soon acquire/hire officers who bring a lot of story and personality to the game.  Officers offer various bonuses and all of them have varying story plots and interactions.   You being with the life-giving resources of fuel and supplies.  Fuel powers your ship and most importantly it's lantern, supplies allow you to feed your crew and keep their hunger at bay, though there are other....... options for a ravenous and maddened crew.The locations themselves are as much a character as any of your Officers, or indeed yourself. They all have a lot of story attached to them - some humourous, some sad, some eerie, some horrifying - all of them unnerving and a little unnatural.  As you explore you will reveal the Map of the Unterzee - for as long as your Captain lives this is how the Unterzee is, if he dies though the map will have changes and things won't necessarily be in the same location - unless of course your legacy allows as such.This brings us into the life, and death of your Sea Captain.  The game clearly states : Expect your first Captain to die.  While your Captain doesn't have to die, do not be surprised when it occurs and do not be saddened as your legacy will live on, if you so choose.  You can acquire better accomodation in Fallen Londer, write a will and bequeath things to your successors, in this way every failure can lead to a future success, one where everyone in your line has contributed - an epic journey, one that beautifully mirrors the way the game plays - slow, methodical and punctuated with elegance and horror.   Being a Zee Captain though isn't just about managing your lineage, it is also about managing your ever present crew. Your base crew are faceless and man your ship, but like all good Lovecraftian horror - it is the faceless who help provide that simmering tension - the crew can, at times, throw a spanner into your plans with an impromptu fit of terror, deity attracting worshipping or the impetus to find supplies.. now.  This interaction is largely through small information boxes that appear mid-journey offering you a choice of what you want, or should I say, can, choose to do.  Interacting with your Officers can be achieved by story plot/location visits, or you can initiate it through the interface of your ship.  As you gain Officers you assign them to their respective stations where they give you bonuses - ie Mascot, Chief Engineer, Ships Doctor, Navigator etc..  Officers bring a lot of story to the game, interact with them and reap the benefits.Finally locations can be interacted with.  When you dock at a location (Default is E to dock when close to a port/dock) an information panel is opened and from there you can interact with the location - be it a colony, shrine or another ship.The game is presented in a 2d top down view, interactions are through mouse clicks on information panels that open up. You have access fo a Captains Gazetteer - it has six tabs which allows you to access and interact with locations/information. (By default G opens or closes the Gazetteer). Through the Gazetteer you can access your journal, view your ship, look at shops or repair docks when in towns etc..Gameplay wise it is a rather simple affair, guide your ship around attempting to make a profit and solve plots with the rather meagre resources. The ship is controlled with the WADS keys - to turn or increase, decrease speed. The E button is your default interact button which you can use to Dock/Undock, sound the all clear from battle etc..Managing your resources is integral to your survival. Fuel obviously powers your ship, it also powers your lantern (of vital importance in the dark Unterzee).  The lantern burns a lot of fuel though and you may find yourself short on fuel and long from home - do [u[Not[/u] get stranded at Zee.Supplies allow you to feed your crew (and yourself) while at Zee.  Feeding your crew actual food is more beneficial then the alternatives, there are no fat crew on Unterzee ships, at least, not for long, for various reasons.Terror is a resource you will accumulate as you travel, events can randomly occur to rapidly increase or maybe decrease some terror.  Visiting Fallen London will always lower your terror some.  Collecting various stories/tales and venturing the Unterzee will cause terror to rise. How fast that rises depends on may factors. Littered throughout the Unterzee are buoys of light, sailing near these will produce a lower terror, they are sparsely distributed though. Having your lantern on will greatly lower the rate of terror gain, though it will cost much fuel. Finally no light and the deep of the Unterzee will gain terror very fast as your crew feel the horrors encroach in.  Reach maximum terror and you will go mad and that Captain will relinquish himself to the Zee.Echoes are the currency of the Unterzee, you can gain these via submitting reports of locations you visit to the Fallen London Admirilty, selling goods etc..  With the initial starting ship it can be difficult to make a living through trade.  That said not all trade is of a lawful nature and you may be approached by people who wish to employ you for unlawfull pursuits on the Unterzee - potentially profitable and dangerous.Secrets are another form of currency, as you discover locations you will gain fragments - these add up until they form a secret.  Secrets can be used to boost your stats, or you could sell them to a collector or secrets or you could use them to open up story/plot lines.You can gather Tales of Terror, Zee-Tales, Items of Curiosity and the liek which again allow you to turn in for a profit or unlock story.Best results are achieved not through random exploring - though early in the game this is unavoidable, but though deliberate planning and risk management.  Conserve your fuel and supplies (or preserve your delicious crew), calculate your risks and sail the Unterzee!  Fortune favours the brave, or is it cautious, one never quite knows in the Unterzee.  Maybe you will eek out a wretched living barely scraping by in the squallor of Fallen London, maybe you will discover a higher purpose, maybe you will slip beneath the waves in silence, maybe you will carve a path over the Unterzee guns blazing and returning the horrors back to the Nine Hells, or maybe you will find love and pine for them as hope slips over the rail and plunges down into the depths."
2014-02-09,250260,True,"Jazzpunk is a game that defies allocation to a traditional genre.  At it's essence it is an absurdist comedy intermingled with puns, computer jokes and various mini-games.  There are moments where you will laugh out loud, others that make you smirk and some that may just go straight over your head.  It's a comedy experience, but one that may not be suited to your tastes or the entry price point.The game is delivered in a 60's style TV/film presentation - flashy colours, big stylised letters, obtuse and poorly explained events and an over arcing plot of being a spy in a 60's interpretation of a somewhat cyberpunk world.   While cyberpunk depicted today is body augmentations, guns, guns, guns and a high body count. This is a depiction of late 50's early 60's sci-fi, robots and crazy gadgets in the world of tomorrow!  The presentation is very good and it conveys it's unique attributes very well, I haven't seen this style of introduction since the old No One Lives Forever games (another 60's spy type game).Gameplay wise the game is very simple, you cannot die and the pay off is in exploring everything to elicit the jokes hidden around or to even create them yourself.  It is best to avoid following the main quest until you have explored everything.  On my first play through (approximately 3 hours) I didn't discover everything and I made the mistake of going to pick up on the main quest again while doing side quests and then suddenly finding myself ending the level and missing out on the additional exploration.  You can interact with a surprising amount of the world and things felt rather intuitive in terms of control.  There were some blocks to gameplay though such as when I discovered a door a tried the ye olde tried and true knock that it didn't do anything.  Once I discovered the trigger for the area it was the exact same knock required on the door that I had already performed.  I felt that perhaps it would of been rewarding to have accidentally discovered that rather than being led directly to it.  The minigames are rather frequent and range from mundane to excellent, though I found that the better games were all towards the end of the game, perhaps to counterbalance the reduced humour in the latter stages.Replayability wise there is perhaps not so much there once you have discovered anything, thankfully the best mini-game by far is unlocked for you automatically when you complete the game - Wedding Qake.  It's actually a highly enjoyable rip-off of the old Quake experience, albeit fighting bots (who moan and complain in chat humourously) rather than other players.  I would guess that the short play experience is probably quite beneficial to the game overall as prolonged humour can make the player continually expecting increasing funny events which is very hard to maintain.So if you like absurdist humour you may find this game right up your alley, if you find such surreal things annoying or particularly unfunny then you best avoid this product.One last thing to point out, currently on Steam this is listed as $14.99 USD, quite a steep price for the short length of play and amount of content.  If this goes onto a Steam Sale I would definitely recommend it as a purchase (ie if it's around the 7.50 or lower mark), but at it's current price point it really is best value for those who enjoy this sort of humour."
2014-01-23,211600,True,"Released in 1999 Thief Gold is the re-release of 1998's Thief: The Dark Project the wonderful game from the sadly now defunct Looking Glass Studios.  Originally Thief was known as Dark Camelot and intended to be an action RPG type of game and you can see throughout this game where they recycled content from that original game - ie medieval influenced missions.  it later morphed into Dark Project when they found that the stealth aspect (championed by Paul Neurath) was a lot more entertaining and that a game involving stealth and thievery would be a better option.Rather than being a straight re-issue of the game it was an early form of what we now know as GOTY editions. It includes 3 extra levels: The Mage Towers, The Thieves Guild and Song of the Caverns.  In addition to extra missions it also tweaked the standard missions some minor tweaks in most and then a couple of levels receiving reworking notably The Sword (added more area - ie Little Big World), Undercover (story changes), The Lost City (enemy and story changes) and Down in the Bonehoard is retextured.  Furthermore Thief Gold moves the version up to 1.37 from T:DP's final version of v1.33.  On the old discs you also got a preview of Thief II and of course the additional mission the Blooper Reel (Lord Baffords Manor featuring entertaining bugs and humorous content)At present the cut scenes do not function on some systems, notably Windows 7, there are various work arounds available - they can be found over at ttlg.com (file is called Tfix_1.18c) or if you so wish you can always Youtube the Thief cut scenes.  I highly recommend you watch the cut scenes, not only do they advance the story and reveal a lot of twists and turns related to it but they are also beautifully crafted and remain a joy to watch.The concept of Thief is simple, achieve the mission objectives by the use of stealth.  Stealth in this game pertains to use of shadows, sound and movement.  To aid you in this you have a light gem in the lower section of the screen that indicates the amount of light you are currently exposed in.  Sound is highly important and was one of the first games, if not the first where sound was just as important as what you could see.  Footsteps on varied surfaces, the sound of patrolling guards and ambient noise all add a rich and extra layer of gameplay.  You need to take these elements and work within them or bend them to your favour to achieve your objectives.The game is set within The City, a steampunkish type era, like the Victorian era on the cusp of industrialisation.  The City itself is moody, bleak and dangerous, the perfect playground for the adventurous. There are several factions within The City all vying for control, the mysterious Baron of the City remains aloof, a figure of power and control but not involved directly.  The ambience of The City is beautiful and it's success is largely due to the presentation of The City, both aurally and visually. The story that unwinds also fleshes out The City.Comparisons can be made to Dunwall from Dishonoured and Dishonoured does indeed play like a Thief game and has that ambience, albeit the focus is on assassination and not on stealth and theft.  Dunwall though is the victim of politics that goes up to the highest level, The City feels more alive though.   There is no apocalyptic plague sweeping the streets and the highest power is not overtly tyrannical but the various factions do give 'layers' to The City, it feels like it has more depth and soul than Dunwall ever had, it is an entity in itself.The visuals are nothing exciting but they are effective enough.  The sound though is truly a thing of sublime beauty.  This is the first game where it was essential to have sound enabled and if possible to have a dedicated sound card (that again has kind of died out thanks to integrated sound on motherboards).  From the fabulous sound ambience to the classical Loot sound it is all very stylised and very integral to the Thief experience.  It must be said that the talents of the voice actor for Garrett, Mr Stephen Russell truly stand out as one of the greatest in gaming. He gives Garrett the very jaded, near misanthropic character that makes the game feel so immersive.  Garrett feels like what you would expect to be a product of hard life within The City it is conveyed wonderfully.  It is wonderful to hear Garrett go into his internal monologues during missions, throwing story, character and enjoyment at you.  Be warned though after sneaking through a level only hearing footsteps and ambience you may jump off of your chair in fright the first time his voice unexpectedly booms out at you. The difficulty levels change objectives and throw in variables such as not killing anyone and collecting a certain minimum amount of loot. At the easier difficulty levels it can be easy to roll in and kill all the enemies in a level, but by far the biggest challenge is to play on the Expert setting and try to adhere to the rules of Ghosting - ie don't let anyone see you, leave things as you found them (except for things you need to loot to achieve the objectives), don't knock anyone out even relock doors you pass through etc.. By and large the rules of Ghosting are self-imposed, a fun challenge to yourself, but a rewarding one.  Consider the missions (levels) to be a big playground at your disposal.The controls are standard controls for the era and you may find you will want to tweak them to match what you are used to playing today - ie alternating strafe and lean keys for instance and changing the walk and backwards buttons etc.  Combat is straightforward - use your bow to snipe targets or to shoot a variety of specialty arrows - water arrows to douse torches, moss arrows to soften the noise on surfaces, rope arrows to climb to other areas, fire arrows to destroy things, broad head to kill enemies/make a noise, noisemaker arrows to create a distraction etc..  The Sword play is simple, space to block and primary attack to swing the sword.  Hold it down for a stronger strike. By far the most useful tool though is the Blackjack.  This item is used to render guards unconscious.  Slip up behind a guard raise your blackjack and then bring it down upon their head.  Then get rid of the unconscious body - be aware that placing a body near a fireplace or in even a small amount of water will probably result in death to the unconscious party - bad if you are trying to achieve a no-kill objective.  So while dumping that body into an unlit fireplace may seem great, it won't be if a servant comes and lights it up :PAt the time of release the original Thief was described as a sneak 'em up (as opposed to shoot 'em up) and it is the precursor of all stealth games that you see today.  The graphics have not aged well, mods can fix that if you so choose and the controls can be quite archaic. But the story remains as beautiful as ever and there is a great deal of satisfaction to be garnered from this game. The reboot of the series, Thief, is to be released soon and while the reboot doesn't follow on from these stories - it certainly seems to take ideas from the series.If you enjoy stealth games, games with an interesting story and enjoy a challenge, then Thief: Gold is a game for you.  It does look dated now but it remains as enjoyable as ever to play.  Make sure you apply the fixes to get the cutscenes working (and improved resolution options) to really improve the gameplay experience for you. Tweak the controls as you need and you should find yourself become immersed in the depths of The City very quickly.  From the first time you pickpocket a guard of a key, hear that chiming loot sound or even your first close shave with your heart pounding in your throat you will be hooked on the game.  It really is a gem of gaming."
2013-12-27,22320,True,"Morrowind, the Elder Scrolls game everyone venerates as the best in the series.At the time of its release it was a sublime gaming experience and an amazingly fun journey.  The original base game was expansive, you could trek for a long time without civilised contact and just become immersed/lost in the rather alien environment that Morrowind offers.  It really was an adventure as you were never sure what to expect beyond that bend in the trail, behind that door or over that hill, but there was always something.Often that something was also + Cliffracer, probably the most annoying enemy to ever be seen in gaming.  Plenty of mods erupted to remove or reduce the constant flow of the hated creature.  Many a Morrowind player could still vividly recall travelling along and suddenly having the combat music start and then a squawk to indicate imminent Cliffracer attack.  That said, it also prompted many to play with the editing tools you could get from Morrowind and an excited community flourished with the toolset. A game that was great fun and you could also add your own stuff? Fantastic.The Character creation and RPG-stat side of things was more complex in Morrowind, or at least, more in depth.  You didn't just level a generic 'one handed weapon' skill you raised swords, axes, maces etc.. it added another level of complexity to your character.  You want to be an expert dagger wielder? Sure have at it! Be a shirtless Redguard knife wielder it's your choice!  Character creation is easy and best of all if you didn't want to be a generic fighter, thief or mage you could simply make whatever type of character you could so choose.  It was that kind of choice which help propelled Morrowind to its revered status.Even with its potential complexity it was also a rather easily accessible game for new players to the ES series.  ES games are wonderfully self-contained you don't need to have played previous games in the series and on top of that this was the first of the major TES releases to be in a first person perspective full 3D which just made it all the more wonderful.  You could quick create a class, get off the boat for the quick tutorial and be out of Seyda Neen and picking mushrooms and stabbing bandits in no time.In the expanse of the game you could be exploring the wastes as an Ash Storm bears down on you, delving into the sewers beneath ancient cities, exploring the dank caves that permeated the region, go crypt delving, skulk through the wonderful Dwemer ruins, hang out in the taverns or even your own stronghold.  Like all great RPG's there was a lot to explore and a main quest littered with side quests to follow.  If you don't want to follow the quest, hey there is still absolutely tonnes to do.Items in the game were wonderfully interesting as well. The Scroll of Icarian flight, perhaps the most wonderful thing to ever throw in the path of a new and unsuspecting player.  I missed them on my first playthrough way back in the day as I went drifting off by myself but oh wow the fun such a potent item allowed.   The game also features the wonderful recall and mark spells enabling you to mark a location and on casting recall to return to that marked location *sigh* such a beautiful spell for stocking your house or making that great escape from angry townspeople/plains people/city guards who you inadvertently attacked/stole from/grievously insulted.Compared to releases today, the graphics are old looking the controls a little annoying and the interface, well it sucks in comparison. But behind that you will find a very solid game that will give you a great many hours of enjoyment and RPG stories of your own.  The game is text heavy and you will be doing a lot of reading but there are voices in the game, just more as greeting/attack barks that sort of thing.  Yes you will get sick of being addressed as Outlander, especially if you are playing a Dark Elf from Vvardenfell who is by no means an Outlander.  The story is fun if a little RPG pedestrian but the enjoyment is in the journey not the end result.The offered expansions are good value, though I feel that Bloodmoon is by far the better expansion in terms of new gameplay options and locations.   Bethesda released quite a few free add-ons (that aren't included in the GOTY edition I believe) that added a few little quests and items (such as female armour, adamantine armour etc..) to the game and it can still be downloaded from Bethesda/Zenimax, afaik.If you can find this cheap on Steam grab it and give it a burl.  There are also a lot of mods/TC’s out there for this game that give it more lush graphics and features if you want a prettier Morrowind experience.Edit: My play time records 7 hours on Steam lol :P Obviously this game was released and played prior to Steam being released."
