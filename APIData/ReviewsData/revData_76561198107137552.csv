2014-11-21,242760,True,This game is amazing! Worth buying but kinda wished we had more the 2 lives and a server to play with more then 2 players+ but overall its a cool game that sometimes(All the time) makes to wet your pants if not a mini heart attack.

2014-11-21,232750,True,Its a good game! But wished there was more stuff which we could do. After beating the game you can't do anything which is quite a bummer since the game would be an amazing place to explore. But overall its a good game.
