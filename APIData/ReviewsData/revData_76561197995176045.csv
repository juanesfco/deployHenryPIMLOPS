2012-10-12,570,True,okay so uh I just like got a preorder of this game after Reddit recomended it........ am I missing something.......?? this is just like a ripoff of LOL. all the heroes are just copys..? the champions are boring and unfunny and have no personalitys. and having all the champs at the start instead of having to pay 4 them........... uh news flash its a little overwelming to a newbie.... i just dont get what people see in it its just sad rly
