2014-11-14,289650,True,"I have an ASUS G73HJ laptop and it doesn't reach the minimum requirements by anny stretch of the imagination but after updating my amd drivers I was able to boot the game and run at a stable 30-35 frames. The game would often spike to 60 frames when there weren't many civilians on screen, mainly rooftops so the games isn't too intense and you do not need a crazy gaming rig. Aside from the framerate the game is absolutely amazing."
