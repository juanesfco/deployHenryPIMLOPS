2014-04-04,212680,True,Enertaining and addictive! Probably the best rogue-like out there by a longshot! I Highly recommend it!
2013-12-31,200510,True,"The most brutally addictive game I've played since Lich King era WoW. The new expansion Enemy Within adds a whole new layer of awesome, though the base game is full on enough to keep newcomers intensely occupied for countless hours so don't sweat if you can't afford the expansion straight away. After nearly 7 years of full-on WoW, this is the game that broke its back for me!"
