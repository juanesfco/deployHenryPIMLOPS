2016-08-09,55230,False,"sub-family guy level 'Irreverent Humour' written by teenagers. one quest has you drugged and probably sexually roughed up a bit while drugged and then you nude escape from a brothel while drugged, on a cart pulled by mostly nude gimps, and the entire sequence feels like it was written by a 16 year old boy who masturbates to eric cartman. the real charms of saints row 2 and the ridiculous, balls-out actually fun nature of saints row 4 just aren't present here. this is the worst of both worlds."
