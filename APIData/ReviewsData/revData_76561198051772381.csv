2016-07-11,273350,False,"Ai as monster in matchmaking should at least be more balanced because they only aim for medics not any 1 else, I always attack the med when i am the monster but im not as brutal as the ai because everytime i ply as medic ai always tries n kill me n not any 1 else, the ai will chase me down till i die. pls balance the matchmaking ai as monster because for me medics r useless when ai is the monster in matchmaking. But i still like the game."
