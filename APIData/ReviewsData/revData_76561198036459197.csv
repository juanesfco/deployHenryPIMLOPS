Overall, great military simulator.. but it is a SIMULATOR, this isn't Call of Duty fellas, yes there is bang bang in every mission, but it it a simulator (cannot stress enough)! If you want to get the most fun out of this game then you need to role play and not go all CoD style and run and gun everything with 2 legs (save that for multiplayer). Appart from that, I had many hours of enjoyment and many more to come!"
