2015-06-24,241930,True,"Optimization issues on my PC.Get 50 fps on high, get lag spikes. Put settings on low, get 50 fps, get lag spikes.10/10 Optimization.***EDIT***I managed to fix this issue shortly after getting a new graphics card, adjustment of my drivers and a new motherboard. This seems to have fixed the issue.Now that it actually works I can suggest to anyone who is a fan of the LOTR series get this game because it is very unique in a way and offers quite a few hours of mild entertainment."
