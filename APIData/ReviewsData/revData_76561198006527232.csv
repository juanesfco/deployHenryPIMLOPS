Way too many terrible attempts to pander to fans as hard as possible with jokes that fall flat compared to the ones that are actually funny. Alot of the positive reviews just seem to be people blindly loving it because they are fans of AVGN instead of seeing it for what it is. The movie just had so many cringeworthy moments it was a slog to watch. Alot of terrible characters, like the sidekick who just comes off trying too hard to act and be funny. It does have a few charms and good bits. Like the silly, over the top and cheesy effects similar to bad but entertaining B grade horror movies and puppets that are awful but charming.Bought the movie to suppport the AVGN as someone who enjoys his content, but could never bring myself to watch it again. Just painful."
