2014-06-22,4000,True,"I personally say that this is my favourite game of ALL time, better than minecraft and better than GTA V. All the add-ons to the game are beyond imaginable. You can add almost anything you can think of from, Planes, Cars, Weapons, Huge maps, items and even things from other games!. I give this game an overall score of 1 billion out of 10 and i definetly recommend it. :)"
