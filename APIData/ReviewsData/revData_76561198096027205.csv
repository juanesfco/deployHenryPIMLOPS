2013-07-05,4000,True,One of the best sandbox games I've ever played! Definetly worth buying If creativity Is your thing
2015-12-24,730,False,This once simple and fun game has gone proffesional and is now more suited to hardcore gamers as majority of it's fanbase focous on trading and betting. Such a shame as Counter Strike used to be good. If you are either have a talent at moving your mouse fast or are extremely competitive this game is for you.

2014-06-20,233450,True,This game is a great way to either torture prisoners or try and forgive and forget their crimes. I generally don't choose the latter. This game has a great intro and backstory with lots of new things appearing through out the game. Great buy for a sandbox and reform loving gamer!
2014-12-18,203140,True,Great story line and immersive campaign. Great purchase for stealth gamers as there are many ways to take out targets. The game is aimed to be for offline use but the makers tried to make it online but in doing so the game became cheap and plasticy rather than the solid offline experience they wanted. Good buy!
2013-12-22,224540,True,The small fan base seemed to shrink even more. Very sad as this is a really fun creative shooter. If online block builders are your thing then go and get some bang for your buck.
2013-12-15,240,True,Much better than newer Counter Strike versions because the same source textures are used. Better detail a real golden oldie! Perfect purchase!
