2016-02-27,436150,False,"I would love to recommend this game, however the business model and comments by a developer confirming bots and possible non-random cards leaves me with no option other than to say no.There is plenty of potential and lets face it.. poker as a game sells itself. Hats/pins/shirts just doesn't cut it. Put that up next to repeated players appearing with different names/same profile picture.. it just doesn't sit well with me.As far as poker goes.. it's great. But everything surrounding those fundamentals I simply cannont recommend."
2015-05-12,65980,True,"In my younger years I lacked the patience required for long, drawn out strategy titles. As I've matured though, it's naturally what I have gravitated towards.CIV has always been top shelf strategy gaming, and whilst I can see why people turn their nose up when comparing Beyond Earth vs the Giganasaur CIV5 it really isn't neccesary to compare the two. They both (rightfully) stand proud on their own merits and comparing them just brings down their individual brilliance.Let's face it, you probably know what you're getting yourself into if you're looking to buy this game.If you invest the money, do yourself a huge favour and invest the time as well. Don't add this to your list of Steam games that you've never bothered installing let alone playing. Dedicate an hour here and there to sit down and learn the game. Dumb it down a little by running 'quick' game settings so that everything just happens that bit quicker and you feel progress early on.If you put the time aside, this game will reward you (just as the entire series does).I think my only mistake in the past was applying that ADHD mentality to a game that deserved so much more.Slow down, put in the effort and reap the rewards.Recommended."

You really can't go wrong. It will help to increase your skills in endless ways, then let you jam to your favourite tunes.Well ahead of the game and can only get better. Grab it. Support the devs. Then shred."
2016-02-27,252950,True,I neglected it on steam (grabbed it during sales) but have been absolutely addicted once it dropped on XBONE.Highly recommended!
