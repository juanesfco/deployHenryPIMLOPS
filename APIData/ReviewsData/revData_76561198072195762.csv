2016-02-16,359550,False,"Okay I would really recommend this game if it weren't for some really glaring issues, which to be honest wears me down over time. For the record I'm playing in the Oceanic region, so if you're not from there these issues may not apply to you. Positives:-interesting take on multiplayer-diverse character roster with different traits and skills-reasonably priced (not a $100 dollars for a multiplayer only experience *cough* Titanfall *cough*)-fair progression system (big surprise coming from Ubisoft instead of being locked behind a micro-transaction)-solid gunplay and action-strong focus on teamwork (choose not to respect this, and prepare to get your ♥♥♥ kicked)-decent variety in scenarios and maps which cleverly blends the two aspects-genuine tense moments Negatives (brace yourselves this may get lengthy):-clunky matchmaking (this is a BIG negative as it tends to favour hosts with high latency. More often than not I join players with 300 ping minimum, making teamwork at times impossible and being shot by laggy enemies)-frequent disconnections and slow wait times (as far as I can tell it seems it uses peer-to-peer matchmaking, reminiscent to the Call of Duty multiplayer on consoles. I found this especially bad in terrorist hunt, as we have 4/5 players in the lobby, I check my watch and on average I have to wait 2 minutes to find one more player! And it's ALWAYS one more player! Worse yet we can't start the match until we have a full roster, even then good luck because chances are you have 300 ping minimum. To rub more salt in the wound, when I leave the lobby I have to wait on average 15 seconds to reach the god damn main menu most of the time)-lazy tutorials (a bunch of short videos that show aspects of gameplay, but I had to dive into the options menu to figure out some of the damn key bindings. I figured the situations mode was a more in-depth tutorial mode, but 9/10 times I get absolutely destroyed with only a brief intoduction video to show me what the hell I am meant to be doing)-tedious UI (I have to actually be in the operator selection screen to be able to check my ping, before realising I'm bloody connected to a host in the northern hemisphere. Then guess what? I leave to find another host and I'm forced into more loading times----which just adds up, and up into blood boiling rage. At this rate a random dice roll would be better than this ♥♥♥♥♥ of a system)-odd bugs that cost you the outcome of a match (inconsistent kill cams really stood out to me, as one of my team mates shot the last enemy standing escorting the hostage, yet somehow we lost the game. Mind you we saw the kill cam where the enemy died and the hostage was perfectly fine. Another one I experienced was the whole teams audio dropped out, there was muzzle flash but we couldn't tell where the enemy was as sound plays a vital role in this game. My whole team died and in a cruel twist of fate, the sound recovered afterwards)Conclusion: I really did have fun with this game----WHEN I had a stable connection. As I said before, these issues seem to be mainly a regional problem. I feel like I'm spoilt for choice as with TF2 and CS:GO, in a click or two I'm already in a solid and stable game in little time, thanks to my server browser preferences. The game mechanics and scenarios are awesome, but in its current state I cannot recommend this. Ubisoft really needs to over-haul the matchmaking system, if it wants to maintain interest in the multiplayer market long term. I don't want to feel like I'm playing a multiplayer game on a console since finding a game is inconsitent and clunky, which makes it feel dated real fast. It makes me think that the system was in fact optimised for the consoles, which is a bad sign in itself."
2014-03-17,204100,False,"First time I had several problems with random crashing and blue screen. Somehow managed to get past that when I updated the drivers... Then I had to go through rockstar's ♥♥♥♥ty service and its insistence on having to sign in to social club. I entered the activation key (and I already made the option to link to steam) and first time it said it couldn't connect to the servers. So I'm locked out of the game, that I paid MONEY for, and I've barely got past the title screen? Not to mention it accuses me half the time of not being connected to the internet, despite everything else is working just fine.I reboot the game and wait for what feels like 15 minutes while it checks the activation key, and SOMEHOW manages to run the game no problems. The next time I start playing again I manage to sign in with my 'social club' profile and now it comes up with a licence corrupted notification. Now the game is unplayable DESPITE having entered the activation key less then an hour ago.Now the social hub demands that I uninstall the game and reinstall it JUST TO REACTIVATE THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ACTIVATION KEY! Probably because they think I'm a dirty pirate that somehow got the game... through steam... that I paid money for...Is anyone having problems like this? Is there a way to fix it without having to reinstall the entire game? I'm only interested in the single player story, I don't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the multiplayer. Congratulations Rockstar, you sure know how to combat piracy... by forcing a ♥♥♥♥ty service on gamers."
