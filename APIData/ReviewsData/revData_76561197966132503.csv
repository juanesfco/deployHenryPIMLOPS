It's all about breaking down problems into smaller components that can be composed to generate a solution. Very rewarding to see a finished solution working."

This game is just so smooth, and I couldn't discern if the graphics were polygon or sprite-based since the game does such a good job rendering the environment.  The puzzles are suitably challenging and the introduction of new mechanics is paced really well."

2012-09-14,211420,True,"Hands down my favorite game of all time, here is a game that knows what it's about, and doesn't care if you get it or not.  This game is hard, not arbitrarily, but in a way that challenges you to experiement and learn. The setting and story are incredibly deep, and the atmosphere is genuinely haunting and foreboding."
