2015-11-02,290140,True,How do I explain this game.... This is a grind.... and very boring alone.The first time I played as a warrior with my friends. We got pretty far into the game and pushed through the endless grind of the same thing with different landscapes and we though we were doing pretty good.....Then we got to the capital city..................And we knew we had a long way to go. We made a guild and set of to rid the land of which ever dark power threatened it this time.1 week later we gave up and quit the gameMy second time I tried to continue but I got bored with my character and lost my pet (which I don't know if you get back)I played as a guardian and looked like a ♥♥♥♥.I played with koreans and they made me their ♥♥♥♥♥.I sat there and thought about my life decisions.Overall I think this is a good game that can be refined and developed more but you need friends to quench the grind10/10 would waste life again
2015-09-15,211820,True,Fun for the first 50hrs but then my game crashed and I've not been able to play. If they fix this them the game would be a lot more enjoyable. that said it could just be my shitbox of a computer. Fun game that is kinda like terraria but in space and alot more sci-fi which is my thing. If it's yours too then play the games.
