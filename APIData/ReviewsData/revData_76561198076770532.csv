2016-06-16,381210,True,I love this game. BUT there are some major problems that need to be fixed1. theres this problem when you have to restart your game otherwise you wont find or successfully join a party.... This get very irritating.2. You cannot have a party with friends and search online. As of now you have to have 4-5 people in a lobby which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if its you and a friend.This game is amazing and so far very balanced. This is ver emersive with all the fog and music. One thing i dont like is the constant moaning in your ear from idk what its just too loud. I love this game i do recommend and i hope they fix these bugs
2016-02-24,108600,True,hi!!! so this game is great...  NO this game is AMAZING it is a simulator done right and i enjoy every second. Its a perfect world to survive in with a friend. they say they are going to add much more which i believe such as NPC's and vehicles which is gonna be awesome so i must say its a good buy and very fun.
