2015-05-22,203160,True, The start was a little bit slow but about an hour into the game it just sucks you in! Loved playing it and will be getting the next Tomb Raider for sure. I would get everyone to play this game if I could just because I think its got a little bit for everyone. I fur sure recommend this game to anyone with a proper brain :)
