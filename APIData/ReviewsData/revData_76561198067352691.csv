So this game isn't actually bases on the tv series (so anyone can play!) and starts out in a police car. The art style in this game is fantastic, and the story is mainly driven by your choices, such as choosing where to go, and who to kill and save. Overall this is one of the best story led games I have ever played, and would highly recommend you play this game!"
