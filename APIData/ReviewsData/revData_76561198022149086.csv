I have been playing this game for two days already have got to level 6 and have a undead army,gold mine,lumber mill and so on I don't see what all the fus is about! 10/10 i would recommend it to my friends! And to get more units all you need to do is ethier get more money or go and do tournaments and get tokens to get units!"
2015-02-20,346010,True,This game is awesome i can't wait for map maker i hope they have a co-op castle defence or attack and a pvp game mode where you can vs friends or people online with your creations
2016-06-19,387990,False,"Hello all, I was so hyped for this game i bought and then the game hit the start of screen and it was completely black and then it just crashed, Now i did a lot of things to fix this issue and found out its not my computer but the game its self, It does not run for some reason on windows 10 computers with all the requirements to run this game, I will put the game on follow and i have already refunded it, Please devs fix this issue its been 6 months or so since the issue was found, Please hurry it up and fix this issue, New Gen computer systems like Windows 10 should run this but for some reason your game is not opitizmed for it, Heck my computer can run Homebrew - Vehicle, On high graphics but not even start up this game, I was really looking forward to playing this game. All i ask is for the Deves to adress this problem as a major number 1 objective and fix the issue."
2016-06-26,342560,True,"I love this game, I would love to see Sea vehicles as a buildable thing in this game to give it a more deserve feel. 10/10 i would big a massive Tank and airship and conqour the world again!"
2015-12-01,1690,True,This game reminds me of total war its easy for me to understand and play i really enjoy the idea of making an alliance with everyone and winning the game peacefully or full on destroying everyone with massive war ships. Plus the fact you can hijack any enemy space vehicles you want. 10/10 gameplay land battles are awesome.
2015-07-18,4760,True,Had a huge army of dogs vsing pigs the dogs won!... next had a army of angry raging german women vs elephants... some how the women won!?.... later on i played as the good old Saxons made friends with the celts and the nords and the franks and then marched on rome after the huns attacked it.... the battle ended with the great city of rome still standing and its people unharmed. But at least i reclaimed a lot of land off of the romans. 10/10 would try to defeat all of rome instead of half. If your in to rome or germanic tribe or nordic history i recommend you get this game!
2015-07-09,268650,True,"From the Depths has just started working on campagin co-op and PVP and other muliplayer stuff! I like this game so much just the thought of being able to build vehicles that can go in space,sky and at sea and i hope they make it where vehicles can go on land soon.... I have played this game for a month or 2 and its awesome!"
2014-12-01,287450,True,Best game i have ever played one of my 3 favs just as great as age of mythology but 10 times better
2014-07-12,48700,True,Finally finished the game after a year...I made a faction of warlords went around destroying the enemies of the Nords... had the Nords fight all the factions at once. Got them all to sign a peace treaty build up a army took over a castle and then I made the Nord faction rule the world.. got married to the jarl's daughter and the only war that did happen was a bandit war!... Gameplay is outstanding 10/10. I would of liked it if there was a conquest mode in muliplayer so loads of people could take over parts of the map.... Other then that is a great game and the mods are awesome and fun to play. This game is worth getting!
