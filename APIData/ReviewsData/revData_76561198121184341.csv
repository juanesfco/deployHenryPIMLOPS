The competetive matchmaking systim will also be fun and enjoyable.Secondly, You can make money, of course there are people who play this game for a living, but people like me and you can make money from the skins systim. Then by selling them you can even buy games from this money!Thirdly, you can run this game on almost any console or gaming divice you can think of. this game looks acceptable and has decent graphics.Purchesing this game is money well spent. If you want a goof fps; csgo is a good option."
