Only 1 flyable ship, A whole bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t gameplay features that are completely unnecessary. And 90% of the games framerate issues are caused by AI and un-optimisation. If you really want to experience X Rebirth the way it was probably supposed to be, get X3 terran Conflict, and the Albion Prelude Expansion for it... much much better. Most likely cheaper to, and less boob windows and bald 50 year old women."

Also, the game forces you into the Goliath Tutorial when you first boot it up, and it takes FOREVER to load, dont worry, it hasn't frozen, it's still loading, it just takes obscene amounts of time."
