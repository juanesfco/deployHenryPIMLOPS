2016-07-30,224260,True,By far one of my most favourite Zombie games.This game has lots of different servers and gamemodes which can keep you occupied for HOURS!10/10 - IGN

2016-01-03,10090,True,"This game is so much fun!I only had this game for 2 days so far and I have had the most fun ever!I love the custom maps and I am suprised how smooth it runs on my (Pretty OK but still bad) Laptop!I found on Cheese Cube Unlimited, is the most smooth. I run at 60fps on that map and I cant even run minecraft at that!(Not that I still have it, i played it a loooooong time ago on this laptop)"
2015-12-24,4000,True,This game is honestly my most favourite game of all.There are endless possibilities as well as endless fun.So why not buy it while on sale for christmas!Only 3 dollars (I got it for 16$)
2016-09-02,242860,False,"Seems like a pretty nice game.But it's just really dead.I've already refunded this game as the only game was with 2 people on a co-op defense thing.Not worth the buy really, but it looks like it would have been fun when it was alive."
2016-07-30,394690,False,I have a great PC....I got 10 FPS.....I refunded the game and got something else.
