The training facility is basicly a game with bots to play with and very bad placed instructions. Also the key bindings are bad and there is no way to quit the game unless in the home screen but... You can't get to the home screen! I had to quit with Alt+F4. I do not recomend this game at all! It is a free game and only takes 45 minutes to download so give it a shot, there is a small chance you might like it."
