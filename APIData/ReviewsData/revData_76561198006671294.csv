2016-01-16,287980,True,"Probably one of the most chilled games I ever came across. I feel like a Zen right after launching it. Perfect for taking a break from FPS or other competitive games, for playing in the morning or in the night hours. Minimalistic, yet atmospheric and challenging. Definitely worth the money, even more when it's on sale."
