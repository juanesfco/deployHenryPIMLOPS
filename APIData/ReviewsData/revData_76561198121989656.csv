You have a range of characters to choose and all you try to do is be the fastest and get ahead before you get left behind from the others and explode into 'the walls'. It's a simple task but very fun and tricky with all the powerups and other awesome things included in this game. It can be raging to some people though, but trust me at least give it a go because it is SO FUN. Especially with friends! The graphics are simple so you don't need that great of a graphics card which is good and there are a whole load of  maps by default but you can also choose a bunch of other maps made by other players. It really is a great and competitive game!"
2014-07-25,304930,True,"This game reminds me of Minecraft and DayZ but especially DayZ and to say that about a free game is BRILLIANT. The game is so good with many weapons to use to slice, shoot, bash and more to those annoying zombies and the maps are great but make sure that if you go on the Arena map that u are with some friends because if you aren't then you will get pretty bored... trust me there isn't much in that map for 1 person. BUT the other map is EPIC it is huge, filled with towns, militairy bases, barns and more with awesome and I mean AWESOME weapons and other materials for you to use to survive the undead world. But the multiplayer is a let down since you can hardly get into a server in fact i don't even know if you CAN get into a server with the complication of ip's, port's and stuff but the developer might update that so I still recommend this game because of the EPIC singleplayer and if your thinking what the controls will be like and if they are like DayZ's alien controls then don't worry the controls on Unturned are great and you can adjut them if you want anyway. Oh and there is stuff like customization to your character. WOW this is alot like DayZ but just with Minecraft themed graphics. So much to do in this game and it's FREE so i suggest you go and annihilate some zombies in Unturned!"
