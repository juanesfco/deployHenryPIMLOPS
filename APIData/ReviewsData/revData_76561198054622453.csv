A game with crazy ideas like shield and chicken gliding, suicide keg bombings, getting launched out of catapaults. The fun is endless.this game has a steep learning curve, but that doesnt matter, its still hours of fun.with great gamemodes like capture the flag, take the halls, team deathmatch.Its a great indie game and more people should know about it."
