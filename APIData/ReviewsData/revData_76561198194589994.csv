2016-09-05,261110,True,"First of all, the combat in this game is awesome. It has a great artstyle, the game is easy enough to pick up, and its fun over all. I've definitely had my share of fun with this game and on special, its definitely a steal. Only complaint that I do have is that the camera controls can sometimes be clumsy."
2016-07-02,311210,True,"I only bought this game for zombies to be honest, with custom zombies coming out this game will stay alive for years in terms of replayability value. If you're a huge fan of zombies like myself, then buy this for the custom zombies, trust me, its worth your money."
2016-03-04,366844,True,I love it. With every attempt I learned more about the map itself and I got further and further. It's a great experience.
2016-04-26,429570,True,Feels. Extreme Michonne feels. 9/10.
2016-08-27,449800,False,"I dislike the fact that this game doesn't even support mouse controls, which should be a must in this day and age, especially with games like this, where its fast paced. I tried using a controller which the game wouldn't even recognize so I couldn't even play it. At least the refund button worked."
