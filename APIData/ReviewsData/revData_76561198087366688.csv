2016-05-04,315660,False,"Test it if not refund itI got this game after playing the amazing trainz original but have not played all the games inbetween thinking this would be the best one of them all, I was rong very rong yes it has amazing grapics yes it looks good on the frount page of steam but if you buy the deluxe then your basicly throwing your money away the dlc grapics are horrible with it only having 1 main color no weathering or color change from frount to back it was very disapointing oh and the fact it wasent even round like the train that is on the frount page they really just gave up and called it a day put the dlc as $34.99 USD each or buy the #74.99 USD Deluxe edition and get it all what a scam I hate to give it this but it is not worthy of better 4/10"
