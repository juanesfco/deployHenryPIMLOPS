2015-10-08,10680,True,"This is a really good game if u r a fan of the Aliens vs Predator franchise, u can play as any of the 3 species, my personal fav is is the Xenomorph. The tag says that it is horror but I found that it is really only horror when I played as the Marine, and with the Predator all u need to do is go through and Wolverine everything in sight. 8/10"
