Who knew?Things to be aware of - money and ammunition is shared (and so are weapons if you start mounting any on auto turrets - keep an eye on the store count - those are the ones you are using in your team - replace them if you use them or switch to other weapons).  Zombies love attacking barricades but they are usually too dumb to go through a diagonal gap - use that to your advantage.Also remember you can only build/buy during the day.  At night you fight the zombie horde which gets more powerful as you survive each night and the zombies can drop health, ammunition, and bonus cash.  Just don't get yourself killed trying to get it in the later nights!So far I've played solo and with one other in multiplayer.  I'm looking forward to trying this in three and four player multiplayer next.  Should be a hoot."
