2016-09-17,730,True,This game was amazing! I loved:The CommunityThe ServersThe Lotand not to mention that its bloody challenging and thats what makes the game fun.Theres nothing I can say bad about this game.I recently got false VAC banned from the game and im warning to anyone who gets this game to make sure that you be careful until valve fixes the vac system. I was offline and at school when I got VAC banned from CS:GO. I am not wasting another $15 just to get VAC banned again but still highly recommend it. Peace Out.
