2015-12-28,230820,True,"'The Night of the Rabbit' is a fantastic game! For those who enjoy having to think hard and outside the box, I believe this game would bring many fun filled hours!The storyline is nothing to scoff at either, points in the story you might of thought to be plot holes at one point will eventually be sewn up neatly and tied together with a nice finish. All in all the story telling, if graded, is an A+ easily in my eyes.The game, while in all is not overly long, the amount of thinking needed to actually advance will definitely stump you for a good while, that alone is enough to lengthen the game time considerably.(Also, it doesn't hurt that there are achievements. Being a completionist myself, I think you'll have a lot of fun trying to get them all!)"
