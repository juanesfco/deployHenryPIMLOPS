2015-12-08,377160,False,"Okay game overall, I don't like the added emphasis on combat and looting. It diluted the actual RPG mechanics and turn it into some mmo shooter grindfest like Borderlands but it does it worse than Borderlands rather than a story-based single player rpg. Also i'm playing on survival difficulty and i've killed over 100 legendaries and I get ♥♥♥♥ all drops wtf? I can mod a 10mm pistol and its better than 99% of the legendary weapons. I might as well playing on easy. Stuff like hacking, lockpicking and speech is still there to finish quest but honestly just killing them is the better way to finish quest now. Also not a fan of the unlimited, repetitive quest system like the ones Preston Garvey gives you. Just keep clearing  random camps with no purpose to them, like what? It's so lazy from the developers, there's less actual side quest than previous games (less interesting as well) as a result of this implementation of the unlimited quest system.Anyways combats a lot better in this game then fallout 3 and NV but everything else is worse. Questing, leveling(having a level cap is better because it gives the chracters you make identity, like a melee focused character or a explosive focused character, now you can be everything and clear every skill tree its so dumb), factions are worse than NV, story is okay and the dialogue tree is terrible."

2016-01-17,272510,True,"Is there a character that could even possibly EVEN TOUCH Madara Uchiha? Let alone defeat him. And I'm not talking about Edo Tensei Uchiha Madara. I'm not talking about Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara either. Hell, I'm not even talking about Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan doujutsus (with the rikodou abilities and being capable of both Amateratsu and Tsukuyomi genjutsu), equipped with his Gunbai, a perfect Susano'o, control of the juubi and Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju's DNA implanted in him so he has mokuton kekkei genkai and can perform yin yang release ninjutsu while being an expert in kenjutsu and taijutsu. I’m also not talking about Kono Yo no Kyūseishu Futarime no Rikudō Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan (which is capable of Enton Amaterasu, Izanagi, Izanami and the Tsyukuyomi Genjutsu), his two original Rinnegan (which grant him Chikushōdō, Shuradō, Tendō, Ningendō, Jigokudō, Gakidō, Gedō, Banshō Ten’in, Chibaku Tensei, Shinra Tensei, Tengai Shinsei and Banbutsu Sōzō) and a third Tomoe Rinnegan on his forehead, capable of using Katon, Fūton, Raiton, Doton, Suiton, Mokuton, Ranton, Inton, Yōton and even Onmyōton Jutsu, equipped with his Gunbai(capable of using Uchihagaeshi) and a Shakujō because he is a master in kenjutsu and taijutsu, a perfect Susano’o (that can use Yasaka no Magatama ), control of both the Juubi and the Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju’s DNA and face implanted on his chest, his four Rinbo Hengoku Clones guarding him and nine Gudōdama floating behind him AFTER he absorbed Senjutsu from the First Hokage, entered Rikudō Senjutsu Mode, cast Mugen Tsukuyomi on everybody and used Shin: Jukai Kōtan so he can use their Chakra while they are under Genjutsu. I'm definitely NOT Talking about sagemode sage of the six paths Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Super Saiyan 4 Uchiha Madara with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan, Rinnegan, Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, and Geass doujutsus, equipped with Shining Trapezohedron while casting Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann as his Susanoo, controlling the Gold Experience Requiem stand, having become the original vampire after Alucard, able to tap into the speedforce, wearing the Kamen Rider Black RX suit and Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju's DNA implanted in him so he has mokuton kekkei genkai and can perform yin yang release ninjutsu while being an expert in kenjutsu and taijutsu and having eaten Popeye's spinach.

2015-08-01,292030,True,"This game is amazing, I usually find it hard to care about characters in games, but this game makes you feel for the characters so well. Also the post game support from CDPR is phenomenal, so much content from the free DLC.Best game of 2015 so far, probably game of the year for me depending on fallout 4.10/10"
2015-05-24,212680,True,Love this game. It challenging and the RNG makes every playthrough different and refreshing.
2015-05-24,271590,True,The content in single player is extremely detailed and the game is very well optimized. However GTA online is very laggy for example you always see cars glitching and lagging everywhere when driving to your destination and its difficult to get into a heist with all the disconnects. Also you cannot check your ping. Not sure if it actually uses dedicated servers. Overall I'd recommend it for the single player alone.
