2013-08-03,4000,True,"Where to start, Garry's Mod isn't a game, it's anything you want it to be! FPS, Horror, Simulation, Building, Racing, Rocketing and more. Take your favourite Valve characters and put them all in a blender, the only limits are your imagination and amount of internet data avaliable to download ALL THE ADDONS! Get this game, you will not regret it! 1 simple payment of $10= 1 lifetime of fun!!! So yeh...Garry is watching!!!!"
