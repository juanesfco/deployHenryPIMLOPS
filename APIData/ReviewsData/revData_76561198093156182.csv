The ranking system is crap, because it is nearly impossible to rank up and if you lose just one game you go down a rank.Go and play another game, just not bloody cs go."

2014-07-01,218230,True,"this gameHuge scale battles, plenty of guns, and awesome factions. Definetley get this over any FPS on steam or on pc. Bad things is costs a lot of time and money to get just 1 gun, and about 2 mins of only 10 Frames per second when I start if the game abut about after 2 mins of playing, no lag at all.9/10 would buy"
