This was my most favorite game with everything I had been looking for in a ww2 shooter, that was until a recent patch made my favorite, the recon class all but useless with changes to the scope.If you like sniping aka recon in H&G this is not the game for you. Unlike other games you need to invest a large portion of time leveling a basic infantry soldier before you can unlock recon. Once you unlock recon you are then able to use a scoped bolt action, this is great however the scope is so blurry and does not zoom in very far. You are better off trying to scout and aim at enemies using your binoculars then quickly switching to your gun and taking a shot hoping the target doesn't move as binoculars zoom in about 5 times more and is clear.Previously the scope on the recon rifles were like that of the binoculars however with the recent patch recon is a waste of time.If you want to drive a tank or fly a plane this game still has its up sides however if you play recon like me spend your 500+ hours playing something else."
