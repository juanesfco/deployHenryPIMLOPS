2015-02-25,287290,True,"Fantasic game so far! Its challenging, fun, and it's actually quite scary too for once unlike the last few Resident Evil games. My thoughts...*Great gameplay! Its a mix of Revelations 1 and RE6 which is perfect. Its not too action packed while also not being too slow paced.*Raid mode is interesting. Big improvement on Revelations 1.*Guns feel more balanced and somewhat realistic compared to Revelations 1.*AI for once isnt stupid... so far ;)*Graphics are quite nice... Although unfortunately it is only DX9... *No offline co-op on PC?... ugh... not happy about that. I thought there would be considering RE6... *Overall fantasic game. 8/10!One thing that I'm confused about though... why on earth is it being called Biohazard now on the main menu? I have the Australian version... not the Jap version :/"

2014-11-17,289650,True,"Apart from the high system requirements and the fact that there are frame rate problems, this game is actually very good. I really like the character customization and new combat/free run system (even though it took me a while to get used to it).Give the game a chance and you'll appreciate it. Dont be expecting to play this game on high graphics levels if you dont have the recommended specs though. I have the exact specs it is recommended and I get about 40fps - 60fps with everything maxed out (Not including shadows which is on high and AA which is on FXAA)."
2015-01-28,239140,True,"Fantastic game!! Im seriously loving every minute I play of it!Great GraphicsGreat GameplayGreat everything!One thing though... stuttering issues really make the game unplayable when fighting enemies. The amount of times I got killed because the game froze up and stuttered like crazy was annoying. I have the recommended requirements and I even put the draw distance really low. FPS is perfectly fine... but that stuttering and random little freezes though... Hopefully this is resolved in a patch though.Other than that issue, I definately do recommend this game to anyone that likes horror, open world, and a nice gory experience!"
