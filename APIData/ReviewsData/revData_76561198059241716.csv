2015-05-08,304930,True,Great game but should add a background for example before the outbreak you were a cop so you would start off with cop clothes and a gun.
2015-03-24,342480,True,"There should be a leveling up system that starts off as rank one (Private) and also when you level up you get ing game currency to buy guns and upgradeables and be able to change your armor not just your whole skin for example your headgear and torso and also change how your body looks like if you wanna be buff or fat, but overall its a great game and i would recommend this to anyone."
