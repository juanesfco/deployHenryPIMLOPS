Outside of my extreme fandom of this amazing game I gotta say that it is really freaking funny because of the narration of the very talented Will Stamper, has different difficulties just incase you think it's too easy and is just an all round amazing game - also Behemoth is noted for their co-op game design so grab a friend and buckle up for YOUR JOURNEY AS TOLD IN YOUR FATEBOOKS OF .... FATE!!!"

Unlike the original game, you can now perform heists in stealth, ensuring that you get in and out with a payday without anyone raising the alarm, giving you extra EXP bonuses and money. As with the original game you have EXP, weapon, armour etc. upgrades, as well as a variety of masks to really place your individual mark into your heists. The original game had ~10 heists to perform on, Payday 2; however, has over a whopping 30+ heists, and they're always creating more, with pre-planning, a variety of add-ons and ways to 'heist' you'll always ensure a successful payday. But make sure you're ready, because if you're not too careful, the police will be on you, and the Death Wish police give you a major run for your money.So armour up, grab your upgraded guns, don your mask and with your friends, you'll finally find your PAYDAY!!"
