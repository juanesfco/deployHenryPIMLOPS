2016-08-15,427520,True, Factorio is a wonderful game. The object of the game is to build and manage your base/resources. If your interested in a relaxed fun gameplay I'd recommend this game for you. Factorio also has a Multiplayer aspect to it which really spices it up. When you do get bored of it you can always add mods to improve it some more. I played this before it was on steam that's why I only have 1.8 hours on it.
