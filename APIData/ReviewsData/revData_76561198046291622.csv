By the end of the game you'll be kicking yourself reflecting on what you just played through. There's nothing like a game that actually makes you contemplate the meaning of the message that's being sent across, and Spec Ops delivers it perfectly. Graphics are great especially the environment, with the graphics of the people being acceptable. The buildings are also quite interactable, with them sometimes being a must for a strategical maneuver in key events within the story.Varieties of guns are plentiful with all being effective in killing your enemies. These include pistols, shotguns, snipers, auto rifles, grenade launchers and rocket launchers. It's the realism that impressed me with just how fast ammo runs out; making you scatter around for other guns and spare ammunition. There's also added features to guns such as lasersights, grenade launcher toggle, burst fire and silencer, which in the right situation can get you by without a scratch. Sound is excellent with the voice acting, gun shots and music being of high quality. I never had a problem with any sounds whatsoever and the music was fitting to the scene.You can manage your squad, allowing them to flashbang or prioritize key targets. This can be done with your 2 squadmembers specialising in sniper skills, and also grenades. However, your squad are not invincible and if enough damage is taken, they will fall and you will either need to revive them yourself or order the other squadmember to do so (there is a timer until death). You on the other hand will die quickly by taking too many bullets (there's even people trying to stab you) which forces you to take cover often and makes cover a pivotal part of your survival. There is no healthbar but the screen starts to turn grey.Sometimes, you the player are prompted to make hard decisions, and some are set with a timer as well. Even the small ones that paint you as a person of mercy or a person of cruelty are really great.The controls can be a little bit tough to get used to, with some functions being combined onto one key such as a single key binding being both sprint and take cover. The only real problem I have with the game is the bug in which you can't really change your mouse sensitivity within the game itself, and I had to resort to decrypting the game files in order to change to a more preferred sensitivity. Other than that, this game really blew my mind and lessons are learnt through morality. I would recommend for anyone who hasn't played the game yet, for it is truly a memorable experience."
