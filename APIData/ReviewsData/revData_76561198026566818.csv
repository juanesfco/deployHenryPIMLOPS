However, Supreme Commander 2 is still an awesome RTS which lately seem to be fewer and further between...If however you thought SC1 / FA had too much micro-management (with units AND resources), you'll probably enjoy SC2 more!"

Not a huge time-sucker (doesn't require whole hours of attention, just small consistent bursts to keep it going strong), and there's a bit more tactics to it than some RTS games, and a LOT more diplomacy ^_^"

It adds a fair bit of strategy to your basic FPS formula.So if you want your chaingun to capture continents, jump in - it's Free to Play, so it's not exactly going to cost you anything but time..."
