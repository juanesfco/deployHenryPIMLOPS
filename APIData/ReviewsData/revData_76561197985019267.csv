2015-01-19,295110,True,"The atmosphere of this game is amazing... the sound, the music, the ability to hear the voice of that strange person running towards you with an axe screaming...The environmental changes from day to night, the rain and wind and sun blooming thru the fog... it's stunning (Ultra Graphics).I like that every player can almost defend themselves against all foes in some form from the begining by crafting a makeshift bow and arrows.Looking into the future... already one patch in and they have fixed more bugs than dayZ in 3 years... I'm really excited about this game (Espically as it is going to be FREE TO PLAY)."
