2015-09-29,321960,False,2/5 so far...Cons:- The graphics are awful given that this is 2015 (I'm playing on max settings)-  I don't know if this is a bug or just a horrible choice by the dev team but nobody moves their mouth when speaking in cinematics- I am unable to find a way to show a grid when moving in the world or in combat which (at least for combat) is extremely annoying)
