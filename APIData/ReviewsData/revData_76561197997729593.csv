2016-09-13,346110,True,"This game really doesn't deserve the hate in my opinion. Ok yes it's a bit of a ♥♥♥♥ move to ask your customers to pay for an addon when the game is still in Early Access but i'm going to be honest. I Paid $30 for a moderate game that was just starting out. It was interesting but was unable to hold my attention for a long period of time. I took a brake from it. Came back to it last week. There is a huge amount of changes, new dinos, new objects new biomes etc. Theres moving bases now, either via raft or via platform on the back of a dino. This is a huge upgrade to when i initially played ARK. People are complaining about a new DLC, i can't say im happy about paying for the new DLC but, so far i haven't. I may come to buy it in time, but there is more content, unique effects. Different dinos as well as different mechanics in the DLC, not to mention an entire new F'ing world. I don't remember them ever saying there was going to be another world at all. Now there are 3? One of which is completely free, one comes with the game and one you have a pay for. The price is a bit high on the DLC but it's not cheap to make an entire world. There is no pay to win, There is no micro transations, how exactly do you think they are going to pay staff to add more content for you to play without paying them?I would also like to state that this game is a modder's Heaven. Not that many games support mods these days sadly. This game does have the development tools required to make some great mods, which i do use. Ok the initial content may run dry after a while. However the community is giving so much content to this game that is all free to enjoy. This is my first modded playthrough and i'm having a ball with it. Also worth noting is that the newer maps basically arn't finished yet. There are bugs and issues that some modders have run into, but 'The Island' the original map is supported fully. TL;DR: Honestly i believe this game is great, the DLC outrage is not warrented, especially as its far from required. almost 100 hours playtime here and never touched the free map let alone the paid one. Great game with one of the best modding communities i've ever seen. Pick it up."
2015-12-23,225540,True,"This is an excellent game. Great gameplay if a bit repeditive. Personally not a problem to me i enjoy blowing up and killing everything. Have only done maybe one of the story missions however. Been working on claiming territory mostly. What i do need to say however is very important. This game is EXTREMELY resource intensive. Personally i dont have many problems however i have an exceptionally high end GPU which i believe is the main issue that people are having. I hesitate to say it is poorly optimised but that's about the only reason i can think of that i struggle to maintain 60fps on a 970 at 1080p on ultra. The game does look amazing, theres no loading once you enter the game (which to me constitutes its RAM usage, as i have 16g this is a non-issue for me personally) Just be aware, If you do not have a high end system this game will struggle."
2015-08-31,388520,True,"Fun for some drop in drop out, wouldnt play it all day non-stop but i enjoyed the beta. played a few hours. good to play between other games, not too serious. only 90 fov, a bit low but could be worse. starts with mouse acceleration on, turned that off instantly. runs well on my system, 80-100fps. biggest issue was match making, kept putting me in servers that were not within my region, but thats probably just cos its beta, i expect that will be fixed in the full release."
2015-03-13,255710,True,"Ok im only 15 hours in, as steam states, but i feel like i've seen enough of the core mechnics to give my impressions of this game. The game itself is amazing. It's the simcity of your dreams, no really i'm not kidding, this is what simcity should have been. The simulation model works well, the ai adapts to new routes etc easily, and like i imagine happens in the real world people don't just instantly start taking the new roads you build, most of the time it takes a day for the first people to even start using your shiny new roads. It's almost a word of mouth system, where once 1 person uses it they tell people about the new road and it expands from there until its a basic part of the infrastructure. Everyone has their own houses, own work, own school locations etc, people do what people do, they are unpredictable in the most natural way, Traffic congestion is something to consider, but its not the stupid issue that it was in simcity. Sometimes if you plan poorly there will be consequences to your traffic plans, i for instance made a single intersection the hub of my city, while for a long time it was fine, after i placed by 3000th hex of industrial in the industical zone i soon found that my streets were filled with trucks transporting cargo to and from the industry buildings, in mass, like seriously mass there was hundreds, and everyone going in or out of my city had to take a single intersection, this lead to car jams that could span for miles, i even made a mistake on the entrance to my city too, that made the highway backup for miles aswell, this isnt as simple to fix as it may seem. but eventually i believe i have it fixed. but thats the key. IT IS FIXABLE. This is not like simcitys traffic system where once you get to the 10th hour your city is completely screwed. There are buses and trains and even boats! (Which i havent yet built i'll admit) i made a train station for cargo to ease some of the road congestion, however that actually made more traffic issues because everyone was taking a single road. so i made a road with the entire idea of having these trucks on it, they travel above everyone else and go straight to the industrial sectory, this effectively solved part of the issues i had been having, but frankly, like in the real world, there is no quick fix, you cant just build a single road and expect it to fix every problem, yes it will help and yes the ai is smart enough to know this new road is a better option for some of the population to take, but it is not going to instantly fix your problems in most cases.i have one and only one complaint i can level at this game, i have seen some issues with the vehicles running into each other and occasionally clipping through each other, but in most cases one of the vehicles will eventually realise they they are about to, or have hit someone and react as if the other person has right of way and will stop and fix the problem, this is PURELY a visual thing, there is no gameplay reprocussions at all. It is however a negitive to the game so i thought i would mention it. I have no issue at all recommending this game, the price is not even worth mentioning, i wish i'd not bought simcity and this cost twice as much, then i'd be getting my money. P.S. A quick tip, think about your roads, if your fire trucks can't get to a fire, you will loses houses... You have been warned."
2015-01-12,335150,True,"I'm going to be honest... I don't see what is making all the hate on this game, I have played a fair bit, and i find it very enjoyable. its kind of like, realm of the mad god upgraded. There are 3 things this game doesnt have that realm of the mad god has, full screen, permadeath and an oceanic server. Full screen i would like, it would make it a lot more enjoyable experience playing the game in my opinion. though i would like to state that realm of the mad god had weird scaling issues when it went to full screen so i'm not completely sure if i can count that as an advantage over this. As for perma-death, it is my most hated system UNLESS you have some kind of progression system in the game that is built upon death. like rogue leagacy's coins gathering mechanic. Realm of the Mad God took this idea and completely murdered it, making you spend real money to get what, in my opinion, should be the progression currency. (for example you need to buy gold coins to unlock more classes)Lastly the oceanic server, this is clearly purely because i live in australia, for most people this wouldnt be an issueBack to this game however, it has more classes, more abilities, it has a pet system which add active and passive abilities to your character. I guess you don't have things like Archer arrows penetrate but in Realm of the mad god but honestly, 4-6x the active abilities makes me not care. I see some people saying about the whole paying model? I mean yes it's there... It's a free to play game, are you new to the concept of in game stores to pay for bonuses? It's a very common free to play model and is, in my opinion, one of the best. Those who say they are constantly bombarded with things telling them to buy stuff or that it always opens windows going to their 'buy diamonds' page, i don't know what you're doing wrong but i've not had any of this at all. There is a little store button down the bottom? If you click on that you will go to the store i'm sure... Besides that, it's the normal free to play game stuff. I have played many free to play games and personally am quite used to the systems in place here. I believe this game could be a spiritual successor to realm of the mad god, if that's what you're looking for, welcome."
2014-10-08,241930,True,"This game is... it's just too good for words. Not only is the gameplay solid and very fluid as well as intuitive (Though control reminders are given passively in the bottom right corner if you need them). The graphics are amazing, Orc armor looks amazing and slowly gets better as the orcs rise in the ranks. The animation quality is off the charts, i don't believe i've ever seen a game to date with animation quality as good as this has. The animations don't even seem to clip or stutter as you switch between attack moves. I loved the music and sound assets aswell, very suiting to the world. Voice Overs are great quality, suit the characters yet still understandable (In relation to the orc voices).The story, if you are in to lord of the rings and the lore surrounding it you NEED this game. No question, I'm not a lore person, in most games i'll skip cut scenes and i did start on shadow of mordor too, but i don't even know when or how buut somehow i became invested in the storyline and i ended up watching all the cut scenes and the conclusion at the end is amazing, i loved every part of this story and that's not something i say usually.All in all this game is amazing, if i had anything negitive to say about it is that it is somewhat of a short game, steam clocks me at 20 hours at this point, i have completed the story and some of the side missions however, there are many many more. When the story finished i just wanted more. I am truely sad that the story finished. Amazing game, best i've played in a long time, and i am a hardcore gamer."
