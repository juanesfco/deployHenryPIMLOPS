2015-05-22,218620,True,"Pros:-One of the best co-op game of all time.-Fun with friends-A ton of mod to unlock-Nice soundtrack-There are some free DLC's, too.Cons:-Friends/Foes AI are not smart.-The graphic engine is a little bit outdated.-There are no drill that really works properly.-Guard is too much easily paranoid in Overkill and Death Wish Recommended: Buy the GOTY edition when it's on sales and you won't regret it."
