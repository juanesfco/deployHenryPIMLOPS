The anime is one of those rare exceptions where it's better than the source material (this visual novel), but the visual novel has a lot of different scenarios and endings that aren't included in the anime. There are some translation errors but they're pretty easy to figure outI recommend watching the anime first then playing the game, but that's really personaly preferrence, it really doesn't matter. Just what I'm used to.If you end up getting the game or watching the anime (or both), prepare yourself for some deep ♥♥♥♥. As in, I ended up writing down notes to understand the story. It's great. Anyways, get the gameEl Psy Congroo"
