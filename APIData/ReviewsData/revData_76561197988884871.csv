2014-09-07,730,True,"After more than 700 simulated hours it would be time to write a little review on this game. Although, in truth, she became for me something more than just a game. This is because going into it I feel a kind of tension that was akin to the upcoming training. Each new game in the competitive mode is a challenge for me, calling all my gaming skills may sound funny, but I are literally a hundred like me♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shove the thing, if I lose/LOL/. And, accordingly, no more game does not give me such a vivid gaming sensations of the drive, as his own ego after flushed round, those bright, vibrant and sometimes just crazy celebrations in heavy game with more than worthy opponents. There is no game that would give me the same feeling. In any other game I'm so not shouting furiously at 5 a.m. on the whole Ivanovo on their timarov. No more I, with gnashing teeth, almost hair by the ditch after a loss. All this gives me only one game from my library stim in almost 200 games. Yes, I was played 2000 hours in detox, but I only played for fun and fellowship with cranks on different pages, only 300 hours on all two thousand I spent on servers 5x5 and then played from the bulldozer, because the system ranks there was no incentive was not. Here, the higher the grade, the higher the skills oponente, the greater challenge for me/huh/. Not going to talk about the intricacies of the gameplay, because there's lots of them, what about just garnets can be a small report to write. But I will say confidently: gameplay there is a very complex and diverse, with each weapon you want to do in a special way. In General, I want to say that in this game I will play for a very long time that I was even afraid of this prospect and I'm thinking to reduce the number of hours in it... Yet cope with this problem is bad... P. S. As a command first person shooter this game simply has no equal, so 10/10."
