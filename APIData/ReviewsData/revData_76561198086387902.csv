2014-04-17,221100,True,"this is a good game but the kids that play this have made it unplayable. now if the kos people would leave the game alone and go play a fps like cod or something this could be one hell of a game, and the ones that kill fresh spawns come on the no challenge in that, its a survial game not kill the bambie and take his pants. now the game is great, love it dont get me wrong, it's you the players that kos and take the fun out of it for others thats the issue."
