2016-07-04,422970,True,Friend told me to check it out. Next thing I know its 5am.Awesome game for those that like a challenge that doens't hold your hand.
2016-03-03,427520,True,"Can't speak highly enough. Only 10 hours in, near perfect experience so far. Only a fraction of the way through the mechanics, already heaps of replayability factor. Can see myself sinking a lot of time into this.This could easily be a full release, and after 4 years of development still more to come?Big ups Wube."
2014-10-05,241930,True,"From someone who usually only plays multiplayer games, due to the lack of meaningful gameplay choices and low skill ceiling in most single player games: Shadow of Mordor is awesome.While not being that inventive with the combat mechanics (very similar to recent batman titles), this game does go a long way towards making your actions feel like more than checkpoints in a story.The captin / warchief system is simple yet engaging, the results of death or ruining a captain feast are actually dynamic, not just scripted polarised choices.Set a captain on fire by shooting an arrow into a campfire during a fight, 5 mins later he invaded one of my missions looking like a burns victim covered in bandages quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. 10/10As for the price changing every second day?1 day after release $702 days after release $493 days after release $65?I am confuse"
