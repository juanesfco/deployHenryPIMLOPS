2015-06-12,322920,False,"Purchased game on sale. Installed game. Hit play, PC completely shut down. OK, rebooted it. Verifiyed game, run game, click play, PC shut down. Uninstall, request for a refund. I'm not one to take any game that shuts down my PC automatically. Valuble data can be lost that way and it can screw up my system. I have more than the required specs to run this game, with ease.
