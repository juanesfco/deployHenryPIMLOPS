2014-12-10,206500,True,"Gameplay is pretty good, but this game has it's problems. For one, it has one of the worst management systems for 'friends' I have ever seen. It is almost impossible to add friends while within the game, so you have to go to the website to do it. The in-game menu is extremely limited, cluttering your screen with oversized button for some things, such as how to spend real-world money, while leaving other buttons, notably those to do with other people and closing smaller menus, incredibly small. Furthermore, the game gives you NO INSTRUCTION WHATSOEVER on how to do anything but gameplay. while it does instruct basic gameplay rather well, it doesn't matter if you can't find your way into a match. While the game does also give you links to guides and intructions by other players on YouTube, these guides and instructions are outdated, and differ (a lot) from what the game is now. However, the gameplay is quite good, and the menus can be navigated with some practice. The major downside is the social system.Edit: I found how to add friends. The instructions on how to do so are halfway down this page that gets openned up by this tiny button in the corner. the instructions are two lines out of hundreds, and in this tiny little text."
2013-10-06,570,True,"A never ending bucket of fun, laughs, anguish, anger and hate. Dota 2 has huge amounts of variety. You will (probably) find yourself compelled to better yourself and pull your weight on the team. The game is constantly evolving, keeping gameplay fresh, and the endless supply of other players and strategies, combined with the vast amount of playable characters (heroes), items and game modes makes every game (mostly) unique. The gameplay is reliant on your strategy, decisions, timing and luck. The game is difficult not to enjoy, as even a one-sided loss can teach you and you can still have a good time, even if your face gets stomped in. The only real downside is that you occasionally come across a jerk, but that is to be expected in an online game."
