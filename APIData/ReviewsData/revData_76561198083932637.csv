2014-08-16,211820,True,"Honestly, i don't see why everyone hates this game. It's great, has tons of content, and the only thing i really think it lacks right now is 'classes', like what terraria has. Sure, it may not of been updated for a while. But nightlies are kind of like updates, so there's honestly no reason to hate this. Starbound has a few things it could improve on, like monster generation and terrain generation, but other than that it's near perfect. I'd rate starbound 8.5/10"
2014-05-09,570,False,"Back when i used to play this, it pulled me in. It was hard, and i hated it. But i thought to myself 'One day i'm going to get good at this.'30ish hours in, with 48 hours of research and homework on how to be good, and i still sucked.Horrible game, russians everywhere, don't bother."
