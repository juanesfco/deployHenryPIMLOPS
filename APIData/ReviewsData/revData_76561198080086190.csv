2014-07-22,218640,False,"Very slow and annoying that you cant skip a lot of the cut scenes. I am not very far into the game but after your first achivemnt it stops giving you hints on how to kill the person and you have to figure out random stuff. Like killing Gene, the map tells you to go straight to where Gene is but first you have to stop and get the screw driver from the other guy, but to figure that out I actually had to look it up online. Not much fun and very slow"

2014-07-22,4000,True,I love Garry's Mod and everything about this game. Love going online and playing prop hunt with randoms or setting ti up for Lan parties with mates. Very interesting and different little mini games to keep me going
2014-06-29,265930,True,It's really one of those games you just gotta buy and play. Go in with an opened mind then laugh at all the random stuff that happens. Reall enjoying this one.
