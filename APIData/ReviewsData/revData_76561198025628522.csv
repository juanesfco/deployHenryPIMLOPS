2016-04-08,730,True,"Definitely worth the money. Lots of frantic moments, and a massive (although slightly toxic) community. Only gripe is that as a mapper, the csgo workshop is an absolute moshpit of content, making it very hard to be seriously noticed."
2016-04-08,244850,True,"Okay so this is my review after I learnt how to play:Wow, just wow. Definitely not an action shooter, although it isn't trying to be one. A stupid amount of depth for space, and its close to being done so expect lots of features. My only gripe is that of time of reviewing a patch that basiclly broke movement came out, but I can have faith the devs will patch it soon enough."
