2014-02-10,205100,True,This game can be replayed multiple times and everytime you start a new game you will have more fun than the last time you played. Dunwall is a city full of creative concepts and ideas. P.S. If Arkane studios do not make a sequel than I will find every single one of their employees and ask for a high five but just as they go to high five me I will move my hand so that the high five is failed.
