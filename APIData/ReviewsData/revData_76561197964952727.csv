2015-09-29,384150,False,"TeraBlaster feels like a very simple made Fast Paced Retro Shooter game without much to offer.When you start the game you have 1 life and have to survive through a horde of enemies which quickly becomes overwhelming to the point of almost being impossible to reach over 2 minutes alive time, by that time you will have killed about 300-400 enemies.While playing there will drop boosters which will power you up abit, making you faster, stronger and a few survival gadgets that can help you stay alive longer, boosts typically drop when you kill enemies or big grey/red boxes.When you die, then thats it and you can start over again, there is no unlocks or other kind of extra content in the game and there is one Statistic Menu where you can see your one highest Score in Minute and kills, but only the one highest, meaning no there is no list.-TLDR-+Music picks fits good to the game.+Good Action Retro, Very Fast Paced, with big hordes of enemies.+Ingame Boosters that increase your ships speed and power and add survival gadgets.+/-A Statistic Highscore is nice, but would be better with a more detailed Highscore List.+/-Very quick gameplay, meaning don't expect more than a 3 minute round which you can restart after death.-Almost no Combat View, makes it too hard to stay alive when enemies start moving fast.-Annoying Graphic Animations that confuses gameplay abit.-No extra content or unlocks of anykind which makes the game abit doll in length.Overall during Early Access, i will give the game a 2,5/10.P.S.

2015-09-11,363270,True,"I have played while under Early Access Alpha version and it only had a few bugs, nothing gamebreaking.The game overall comes out really fun, like a rollercoaster ride, but also gets more challenging as you play.+Pretty cool Menu Setup, easy to navigate around in.+Alright Graphics.+Audio is good with some nice rhythm music.+Very easy gameplay controls, but can be hard to master at times.+Challenging gameplay.+Steam Trading Cards ;)+/-Might become too hard at times, some levels turned out to be very challenging for me :)+/-No Checkpoints, i put this as plus/minus cause i think its a matter of personal opinion, this is also a huge part of why the game feels so challenging and hard at times.-Overpriced abit compared to what it has to offer, not much, but just abit.-No Achievements and no unlockable extra content.-Physics feels like it needs abit more work, it can be very hard to control and also makes buggy things at times, such as driving through obstacles can make your car fly around and explode so you have to start over.Overall during Early Access, i will give the game a 6,5/10."
2013-09-28,239450,False,"Good and fun competitive gaming, but quickly becomes doll, because of the feeling of playing the same thing over all the time, it is missing variety in some way, im not saying its boring, its still good and fun, but its just not a game where you can expect to play it for a weekend or have a 12 hour marathon.There is only one kind of gameplay, meaning no Game Modes and its only Multiplayer 1 v 1 online and as you increase ingame rank, having more matches done and higher winning % will make it harder to get into games with other people.There is also ingame Perks and you can add 4 passive to your Monkey, so while fighting it gives you a veeeery small boost, like faster running, better jumping, better wall climbing, more gun dmg or accuracy and such.The game overall is easy to complete, unlocking everything and claiming achievements is easily done.- Why Negative Review?What makes me Not Recommend this game is that you can't play at all without other players and in the end it was almost impossible for me to find anyone to play against, which is abit sad, because it is quite a fun game.I would recommend this game if there were somekind of bots to play against."
2015-09-07,356070,True,"Commander Cool 2 feels like a great Platformer and also has Coop which is a great bonus!It can be quite hard, but you quickly start over with your infinite life, so you can run back and figure out a new way to proceed through the level, which is quite nice.The cartoonish style is also made pretty well, its some nice drawings and they fit well into the game and It also has Steam Achievements, Trading Cards and full Controller Support which is pretty neat.TLDR:+Cool cartoonish graphics.+Nice music picks.+Good Platformer and very challenging if you try to beat it all with 3 Stars.+4 Player Local co-op with also a 4 Player Versus Mode.+Full Controller Support, Achievements and Steam Trading Cards.+/-Can become abit boring in length.+/-Good boss fights overall, but has a very hard end-game boss which mostly feels hard cause of game mechanics being difficult to control, it might need a fix i think.-Very Repetitive.-Few different Monsters and Weapons to fight with.-Missing more variety of different looking levels and stuff in general.-Not very much extra content available, only a few different character picks.Overall during Early Access, i will give the game a 4/10.P.S. I Won Commander Cool 2 in a Giveaway from Orlygift!"
2012-07-18,9860,True,"If you are a Fanatic of The Chronicles of Riddick, then this game is one of the finest creations out there, great gameplay and graphics, the story is pretty well and i love the small RPG aspect of the game, definitely a must try for any fanboy."
2013-11-14,3483,True,"It didnt even take an hour to complete the Story Mode, but this is a F2P game and i played it a lot in World of Warcraft as addon, had some great fishing trips with this game ^^ Extremely fun little time taking ball point shooter game, but i would mostly recommend this if you are bored or tired or on your way to bed, but still just in the mood to play something relaxing and chilling, well then Peggle Extreme is for you =)You can also purchase the 2 full games, Peggle Deluxe and Peggle Nights if you really enjoy this little most enjoyable ball shooting game =)"
2011-12-06,41070,True,"Awesome Action FPS!! Certainly picks up from the Serious Sam Classic's in gameplay and style, unlike the Serious Sam II Failure in my opinion and we also got all the old Menu Features and Game Editor, so hopefully pretty soon we will be able to see more Mods and more Maps.Serious Sam 3 is definitely a Must Buy for all Old School Serious Sam Fans. A Big Thanks to Croteam for this beautiful game."
2011-07-04,42700,True,"Really awesome game, even though alot of people say it itsn't and it might not seem better than the CoD: Modern Warfare 2, but after the first 10 levels you begin to sense a better game, it not nearly or even close to be as bad as people had told me, in my opinion its a good game."
2011-12-27,49600,True,"Very Fun Spaceship Shooter! A Must Try, Perfect Mixing with Music and Gameplay Shooter Experience and really fun with impressive lightshow fighting scenes, sitting on the edge of the chair through battles when music tunes up! Don't Forget Fun Boss Battles with Sweat on forehead ;)"
2013-11-10,105400,False,"I am a huge Fable 1 fan so i was really excited about playing Fable 3 and i wasnt able to play it at release, my pc was simply not good enough at the time.It has taken almost 60 hours to complete fully and thats counted with some afk hours as well, dinner and such... and ive done every side quest there is and really spend a lot of time on searching for chests, pleasing Citizens, ive been taking my time, let me put it like that.Im afraid i found the game very doll and boring in length and it also seemed to be very very childish. Conversations are happening very slowly and you only have 2 options, 1 Evil and 1 Good, also walking around pleasing the Citizens by greeting hundreds of people and doing small walk quests several times gets very tiresome and takes a huge amount of time.I must admit the start of the game gives a good impression and its fun to unlock the main chests on the spirit road and see weapon upgrades, but that is quickly done and the variety of weapons are very slim, also they even almost all look alike.The game overall if you dont complete all the pointless things, wont take too long to complete and the Story Mode feels fairly short and not really that exciting either.Im very sad about it, but i have to say No to Fable 3, i simply cant recommend this, im a huge fan of Fable, but i give reviews after my own thoughts, opinion and experience through out the game and this story simply wasnt enjoyable at all and the gameplay lacked just as much, very doll and boring."
