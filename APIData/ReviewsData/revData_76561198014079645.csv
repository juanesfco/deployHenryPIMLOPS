2015-03-30,110800,True,Excellent is all I have.
2015-03-30,218620,True,"Great fun if you have a crew to roll with, the public games aren't worth the effort if you want to have a high degree of success or play competitively against the onslaughts of A.I on the harder modes, other wise a worthwhile buy if you'd just like something to pass the time and don't care too much what happens, it's just a game after all bro, loaded with Pay to win DLC."

2015-03-30,203140,True,"A good game that unfortunately over complicates the Hitman series with Hollywood like storylines and empty, meaningless characters, took  a lot out of what made hitman, hitman. A good play if you ignore the cheesy crap that is injected into it to appease the masses."
2015-03-30,6860,True,"The best Hitman game ever made, as of Q1 2015."
2015-03-30,220200,True,Fun and innovative!
2015-03-30,219640,True,"Highly recommended, unlike any other game out there, expect maybe mount and blade but this game is fast paced, addictive and has a flavour and humour that is all its own, not for the novice or impatient.Highly competitve but also relaxed, changes server to server."
