2014-06-03,219740,True,Satisfyingly addictive; this game is deceptively immersive.  As I much prefer MMO's I anticipate enjoying the soon to be released multiplayer content 'Don't Starve Together.'
2014-05-26,209080,True,"Fantastic MMORPG.  Other reviews say it all.  Attractive, smooth gameplay.  Brilliant community full of friendly and helpful team players.  If you are female you WILL be treated equally - it's wonderful!  I look forward to a good many hours playing Guns of Icarus.Edit: Kudos to the developers for keeping connected to the GoI community and compensating players after promptly resolved server issues. :)"
2014-04-20,222900,True,"The only real problem I have with this game is it's too short/small, so far/  That said, it's still heaps of fun and super addictive.  Glad I received a Beta invite!NB:  Not a fault of the game itself, but I do wish I knew people playing the game, in order to make game play more organised/strategic.  Constantly playing with strangers can leave much to be desired in how a player interacts."
2014-03-14,207610,True,"**BUY THIS BEFORE #2, no question** [While 400 Days DLC is not essential, imo, it is a fun addition.]Read all the books?  Going crazy waiting for the next episode?  Play the games.  The Walking Dead is a great story game for fans of the comic book series and show to satisfy their withdrawals.   Using the 'Chose your own adventure' format, this game allows you to make decisions effecting your survival and directing where the story goes.  While Glenn and Herschel appear early in the game, all other characters and plot twists are original.If you are looking to fight zombie and shoot things, this is not for you. Keep in mind though, while the focus of this game is an immersive story line, stay on your toes or you will end up dead!"
2014-01-10,200710,True,"10/10 - As a fan of the original Torchlight, I was eager to try out this release and have not been disapointed!  With immersive game play and endless character customisations Torchlight II is highly addictive.  As many other reviews have mentioned, if you are a lover of Diablo II then give this game a shot.My favourite feature in Torchlight is the unique pet system; you chose from a wide selection of strong companions with customisable gears and skills.  These companions are very functional and an important support tool.  They can be fed different food (that you fish yourself from ponds discovered throughout the game) which morph your pet into different creatures that provide various stat bonuses for a limited period of time.Well made, no problems at all with bugs etc."
2013-12-26,105600,True,Highly immersive game guaranteed to get you addicted.  Unfortunately with the release of a similar but way more detailed game I don't see a huge future for Terraria.
