2015-01-31,246620,True,Just... 10/10 not even joking right now. Really good game. Might not be for everyone as it can take a while for some rounds but great great fun :D.
2015-04-29,252490,True,"Great game altogether! The game has a great multiplayer experience. On one hand, there can be players who are kind and try to help you as much as possible, then on the other hand are the players who love stealing other peoples' items/materials etc, which can be very entertaining at times.Gathering materials can be quite frustrating at times, but once you achieve building a house, securing your area and establishing allies, the game gets very exciting.Raids are a great part of the game as well. I tend to partner up with friends and allies, grab as much C4 as possible, and raid every base in sight. Some bases may have few materials, but most of the time you'll find heavily fortified bases that have too many materials and weapons to count.To conclude, good game, buy now."

2015-03-16,313120,True,Not a bad game for alpha. I think with future improvements with realism and other aspects of the game would make it more fun for everyone ;D.P.S. pls no sharks... pls no...
