2014-12-18,233250,True,"Pros:Artstyle , i absolutely personally love it AI , very intelligent , knows what its doing and kicks real ♥♥♥♥.Cons:Gameplay , it lacks a real backbone and storyline to really set the game off.Performance , optimized to an extent but really hurts lower end systems.Lack of diversity , didnt feel very much like its predecessor 'Total Annihilation' , sadly did not have any 'Experimental' type units :( and every 'Faction' had the same Units.Overall , i rate this 7.6/10Although created completely from scratch , i feel it needed a backbone."
