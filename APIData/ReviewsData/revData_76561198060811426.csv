2016-01-22,252950,True,"Better than FIFA. 10/10. But seriosly this is a great game with fun and very competitive gameplay. The DLC is cheap and and completely optional (Not like EA with their Battlefront game). There are heaps of customisations you can make to suit you and you'll spend a good amount of hours on this game because of how good it is. Rocket League is not a cheap cash grab like alot of other indie titles (I'm not saying indie games are but I'm looking at you Stomping Land). I reccomend this game to anyone who wants a reasonably priced game where don't have to worry about 12 year olds F*cking Their Mums and who are just looking to have a good game to play. This game is a solid 10/10 (For real this time). To those who read my review, Thank you and I hope it makes consider getting Rocket League."

2015-11-11,377160,True,Unforntunatly I would really like to reccommend this game while it is fun I am having too many performance issues (major frame drops) to give it a thumbs up. I have a GTX 760 incase anyone was wondering. If these issues get patched I will change the review.EDIT: The Patch for the game has made it signifcantly more playable and I get no more performance issues the game is amazing so bloody buy it
