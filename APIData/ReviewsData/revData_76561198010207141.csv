2013-08-12,1690,True,"Really, when it comes down to it, Space Empires V is fairly bad (especially compared to SE4). This is mainly due to the broken graphics and AI in some cases, but I love it. I love the ideas that it employs, such as RP-aimed features and decent race customisation options. That being said, if you really want to enjoy SEV, your going to need to use mods. While the modding community is pretty much dead, you can still find some good ones on spaceempires.net . This is made easier by the fact that the game has native mod support for drag-installation into a 'gamemodes' folder (in a game from 2006!). Unfortunately, one can only be selected at a time. I am yet to find a program that automatically merges textfiles and still have themwork ingame (though I didn't search very hard (if at all)), so if you want to use multiple mods, you will need to manually go into the files (something like notepad) and combine the differences (though I usually just replace the smaller folder with the larger one, because I'm slack). While this is a hair-splitting process in itself, it's not uncommon for there to still be conflicts after your done anyway, not to mention that the files can actually be very large, meaning it can take a fair few hours depending on what you're doing (if you're commited enough to actually finish merging them and not resort to my way).Anyway, there are also still a few tutorials on mod creation and modifying game files out there for any interested, which is nice. Oh yeah, before I forget, make sure to play the game windowed if you don't want to experience unplayable white-screening. This is one of the fairly common graphical bugs with the SE5, but to be honest, these didn't bother me very much. The AI isn't great, either, which is usually one of the features people critisize the game on, but there are a fair few improvement mods out there incorperated into total conversions and the like, which is the type of mod you'll be finding most of the time anyway. Overall, while SE5 definately isn't for everyone, it may charm those who are looking for a fairly old-school 4X and don't mind using hastilly-patched together modpacks. Got all that?"
