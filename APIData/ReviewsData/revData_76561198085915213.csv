2015-11-09,375820,True,"I love these developers art style so much! The music is almost as great as it's gameplay! $10 is very reasonable for this game, it has a really nice concept and they've even put a story in! I really like that it's not just a puzzle game, but it has a story to make you more interested. I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who likes casual, non-mindboggling puzzle games!"
