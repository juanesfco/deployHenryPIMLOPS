I have lost track of how many times ive run for my life only to end up being eaten by something else entirely - but i keep going back for more! :DThis survival game is unique, fascinating, exciting and sometimes damn frustrating. Everytime you log onto the ARK you can find something new. No two days on the ARK are the same. One day you could be stalking raptors for an eligable partner in crime. The next, freezing to death while scouting on your pteradon. Or even on the next, being impaled by an angry Trike you accidently hit while foraging.Thats another thing:  there are soooo many dinosaurs! Rex's, Raptors, Stegos, Brontos, Anklos, even Mammoths! (yes, i know they're not dinos. stay with me). You name it and im pretty sure its in this game - or will be very soon. The Devs are constantly working on it with bug fixes, dino updates etc. The dino-pool is ever expanding! Plus there's a decent ancient-mammal-pool too. And between you and me, only MOST of them want to eat you ;) Summing up, this game is awesome and unpredictable, and that keeps it ever fresh and exciting. Money well spent in my opinion :D"
