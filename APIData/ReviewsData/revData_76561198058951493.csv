2014-07-01,233450,True,"I remember seeing this game around, a year ago, lets say, it was good then, but it's even better now. Maybe not EVERYONE likes this game but, the amount of DETAIL put into this game is just, amazing.The game is about running a prison, and it sticks by it, your prison is in your hands, BUT, my favorite part, is that it's not FULLY in your control. Sure you can assign patrols and use non lethal, but VERY effective tools to placify an inmate. But even with that, you will always get TERRIFIED if one prisoner starts rioting, and they take out a weapon, the guards can fight them, but they attack OTHER inmates, then its the matter of getting a guard ASAP to the area, or risk a life or 2, and recently, when the ability to FAIL was added, suddenly you couldn't let the inmates escape or let a riot go on for too long, which made it MORE intense when a riot broke out.The developers themselves are probably the most best ive ever seen, they never get off track with other ideas, as explained in one of their videos, but, they take ideas from all the players, and get the community and, are now working to wipe most of the bugs out of the gameAs mentioned before, not every person may like this game, partly because of the amount of patience needed, but, i dont care, in my opinion, also, the freedom of the modding community is perfectThis game, takes the idea of running a prison, and strategy, and mashes it up into one game, would i reccomend it, OF COURSE, i have put hours, not only building my OWN prison, but downloading others, huge riots, fires, and a prison built for 16 must quickly be adjusted for 45!You dont have to, but to sum all of this up in 3 words, they would be: BUY THIS GAME"

I reccomend getting it on sale or waiting a little bit longer."
2016-03-11,323610,False,"I mean, it's O.K. I'm not exactly one to write an essay about games. So. If you like this game, don't get it, get a different game. I have it in my library, I think it's called 'Emergency 20XX (It gave me multiple versions' and there's another one, get these instead. At least in those games. The ambulances RETURN after taking patients to the hospital, this allows you to avoid calling 10000 ambulances when you don't need them. They have all the same units. You may even think they are identical (Part of the reason I got the game), but the other games are pretty much just a more polished version of this game."
