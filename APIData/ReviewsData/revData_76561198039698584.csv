He does some tricks on the way down, barrel rolls, backflips, enough to get the adrenaline flowing. I can only hope that the rush is enough to dull the pain.All jokes aside however, this is definately the best proximity wingsuit flying game to date. Well optimized, handles great with a controller. I am truly exited to see how this game turns out."
