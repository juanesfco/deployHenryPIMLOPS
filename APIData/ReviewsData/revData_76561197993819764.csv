Don't expect a story because there is none, although after you've beaten it, you realise that there was actually a goal for all this.It's a fun, simple, minimalist puzzler that makes no big promises, and yet is pretty fun for the short play-time. It's made by 1 guy and it's free, don't listen to all the crappy negative comments, just enjoy it."
