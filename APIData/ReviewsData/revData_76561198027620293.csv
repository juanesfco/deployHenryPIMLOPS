With your defective drill that breaks every 2 seconds, you can blast your way into vaults full of other people's hard-earned cash. You then proceed to slowly inch your way to the van with the cash weighing 60 tons on your shoulder, and with the cops trying to kill you because they hate clowns.Stealthing the missions is really fun too. After robbing the last bank, you now know that people hate clowns and will s**t themselves upon seeing one. So you decide to play it quiet on this new mission. There are dozens of coulrophobic guards roaming the area. One of them gets too close, but luckily you have your silenced pistol. You headshot him, and answer his radio. You then bag his corpse and throw it in the ocean. He will never have to fear clowns again.As you near your objective, you see another coulrophobic guard. You think it's ok to take him out silently with your pistol. Little did you know, a security camera witnessed you killing that coulrophobic guard in cold blood. The alarm sounds.You f**king blew it.11/10Would be a clown again."
