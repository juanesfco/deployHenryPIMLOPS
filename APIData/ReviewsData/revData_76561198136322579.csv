You can 1 v 1 people just with one computer and battle randoms! The multiplayer does'nt have anyone on there, i know the community is'nt dead but why is this?-----------------------------------------------------------------You can change the chess peices and the look of the game over general. Alot of variation and is very good.-----------------------------------------------------------------Playing against bots is as great as playing against another human player!There are a selection of levels and you can pick which one to verus!----------------------SUMMARY-------------------------------So for people that dont wanna read here is the summary.8/10 Amazing Chess game with many ways to play but not much online matches."

Its not fun when you have a good pc and the best way to run bo3 is ♥♥♥♥.The zombies was enaging and quite fun.Multiplayer felt like they thrown you into the game. Campain was, fine but it didnt feel like the other cods.Overall i'll give it a 3/10. It didnt feel like the cods i played."
