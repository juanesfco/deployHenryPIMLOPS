2016-08-26,298050,True,"I love a good space strategy game but this didn't reel me in like I thought it would. It's very Sid Meier-esk with its tech tree and diplomacy, and I found dealing with other races to be quite rigid and predictable. It's a bit of a slogh with keeping up food, production and tech, unfortunately there's no innovation with how that played out. I tried to play very tech and diplomacy heavy (i'm a lover, not a fighter) but had to fight out a few unwarrented battles which wasn't that exciting.Overall, it's okay. Smooth graphics, soundtrack was nice, a few quirky tidbits but nothing really keeping me there. I'd wait for a sale to get this one, it's a good time waster."
2016-03-30,282560,False,Very much still an alpha build. I really hope that this improves before it's full release. I would be much happier with a graphics rehaul of RTC3 than what they have tried to do with RCTW. Please make it better and listen to our feedback.

2016-09-09,423580,True,If you loved Sim Tower then this is for you. A little bit more in depth than the original title however I cant see much repeat gameplay happening unless they expand on it. It's nice that it's open to modding however.
2014-11-24,239030,True,Really addictive for something so morbid.
