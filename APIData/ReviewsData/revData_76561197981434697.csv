Best reserved for those who had the privelage of playing this while it was current. I highly recommend it, however, it may be difficult to grasp unless you have played it once before or at least have a basic understanding of at least one game in the stronghold series."

While playing its interesting how often the players desire changes from 'I want to catch something on camera' to 'I donâ€™t want to see any more paranormal events'. A dark room, loud sound, and higher graphic settings is the best way to play. It would be cool if there were more area to explore but I still recommend it."
