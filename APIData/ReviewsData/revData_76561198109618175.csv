2015-05-26,233450,True,"A very interesting concept with a few minor glitches, Prison Architect changes tycoons in many different ways on how to manage and control things. Gameplay, you start out with a few workers to build your prison and make money to hire guards and other special workers to make your prison better and sometimes things get out of control real quickly. Audio, sound in this game is pretty good like for example rioting which sounds pretty real in my opinion. Replay ability, this game is flesh every time with new ideas on how to start a prison and manage it. Player friendly, the game is a little complex for new people with micro management and guard management can be tough for new players, plus CCTV cameras and programs. Cons, few bugs and weird graphical glitchesâ€™ but new updates are always at the end of the month. This game will be a little complex for new people and will take some time. 7.9/10"
