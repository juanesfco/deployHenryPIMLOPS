It really gives you a sense of satisfaction when you complete a level in this frustrating game. You might break a keyboard or two in the process, but the feeling of finishing this game is amazing.If you're a fan of games like Super Meat Boy, this game is definitely for you."

Many of the features were brought back such as Keycards, Skull Cards, Barons of Hell, and many other enemies and features. How ever, there is two things I did not enjoy about DOOM 2016,* It didn't feel as ambient and ominous as DOOM 3. DOOM 3 really set the tone for Doom. Stranded in Mars, Hell's taken over. The experience I had in DOOM wasn't as scary and interesting as DOOM 3. The jumpscares in DOOM 3 were amazing, and everything was just creepy. I may be kissing DOOM 3's ♥♥♥ here, but that's just my opinion.* The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ double-jump. It felt like I was playing a CoD game. So overall, I would highly reccomend DOOM to UT veterans and Doom enthusiasts,"
