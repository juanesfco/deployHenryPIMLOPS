Took me awhile to work out how everything works and the mechanics are still pretty confusing, but a beautiful, minimalistic, dungeon crawl FPS. My one gripe is that some of the enemies are a little OP (turrets shoot you while still in 'powering up' mode, bomb bugs move fast too fast, they get in your face when you shoot them)."

2014-02-10,229580,False,"Boring and tedious. Nice scenary however. As someone who usually goes for this sort of narrative game I can say that I'm just disappointed by how unengaging the 'plot' is, which is really a major flaw considering this is the only thing the game could have going for it as the game-play itself is simply repetitive and uncomplicated.JUST BORING."
2014-10-30,329830,False,Says it's an hour of gameplay. I did two playthroughs in 41 minutes with about ten minutes of wandering around uselessly. Boring in every way.
