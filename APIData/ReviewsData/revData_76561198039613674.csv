2014-08-16,270170,True,"This game man this game...This game pulls at the heart-strings, making you want to right the depression that you are facing.I had picked the choices that were right to me, i wanted to see myself through this game without shedding a tear... and i didn't.I shed tears not when in the state of depression but seeing that my choices affected the mental instability that the character faced. 10/10I also adopted the kitten."
