2015-11-15,72850,True,Endless amount of quests and things to do i can't play more than a few hours of most games but i could play Skyrim endlessly.
2015-07-12,7670,True,I haven't played that much Bioshock yet. About half way through. Bethesda has done an amazing job with this game and i plan to buy the sequel as soon as i have enough moneys. May favorite RPG to date.
2013-11-29,570,True,the best games i have played so far. I live in Australia so i dont comr across Russians and such as frequently. Alot of people say the commmunity is toxic and i would have to disagree. The most toxic people i have come across are people in Low Priority which is probably the reason they are there. But if you cannot take critisim the i recomend NOT playing this game.
