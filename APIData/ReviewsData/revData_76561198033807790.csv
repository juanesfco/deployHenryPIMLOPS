One of the reasons why it is so addictive is with every initiation of the game, it is randomised, and therefore remains refreshing on every playthrough. It's good that its like this, since there's a long progression path to unlocking everything and unlocking platinum god. This game is a must have. 9.5/10"

An extremely addictive RTS MOBA, it strikes a nerve in your competitive side to keep playing. And you should."
