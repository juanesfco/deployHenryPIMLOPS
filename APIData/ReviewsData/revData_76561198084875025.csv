2016-05-25,364360,True,"Total War Warhammer is a classic TW game with elements from the table top influencing it. The addition of actually interesting quests, customisation of heroes/Lords and the way more diverse tech tree makes it one of the best TW games to date. Although I don't have many hours in it yet, I feel like I had to counter all the ridiculous negative votes. Haven't had any game breaking bugs or glitches apart from 1 or 2 visual bugs while fighting underground."

While a great game Dark Souls 2 lacks something which the previous game (Dark Souls 1) had. Firstly the soundtrack in DS2 is not as good the one amazing pieces in DS1. The Firelink Shrine theme brings out so much nostalgia and is so memoriable which DS2 lacks among it's musical pieces. The boss fights in DS2 are amazing and difficult however the repetitive 'Knight' or 'Swordsman' Bosses can get a bit annoying. One reason I probably found these fights to be easier in DS2 is probably because I played on launch day and could summon people which in DS1 I mainly played alone. I do not think that the Bosses in DS2 are easier however because there are more of them it can seem repetitive (Still very fun though). I cannot comment much on the pvp because again I played DS1 quite late on my xbox 360 and was not invaded very often. I can however say that the summoning system is a lot better and that there is a lot less lag. The only problem is soul memory which I hope will be patched soon. The actual gameplay is not as tight as the gameplay in DS1 however it is a godsend for players whom experienced a lot of lag in DS1 that the ease of backstabbing has been fixed. Also the guard break is a welcome feature due to the annoyance of turtling in the previous game. However, another problem is the innefectiveness of poise in this game which means I can guardbreak a full havel's no problem. This hopefully will also be fixed. Due to this being my first review it is more of a ramble, however I strongle recommend this game. Even though I have mostly listed it's faults, the game is still difficult and it is easy to put in 200 hours of time into it. Also if you begin to get bored there is always Fashion Souls.I give Dark Souls2 a 4 out of 5"
