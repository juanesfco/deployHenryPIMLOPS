It has a colourful and varied cast of characters, some awesome music, and although it's more casual than something like Dota there's still a good amount of strategy and skill involved.The only caveat is that lag and connection issues can be a problem - unfortunately the game uses P2P networking instead of dedicated servers, and if there aren't too many people playing you can sometimes find youself matched with people from the opposite side of the world."

2015-04-05,261760,False,"I like the concept but I can't really recommend this game - or at least not at full price. It's not a bad game but I didn't find it particularly good either.The story is pretty basic, as least as far as I got. You, Generic Townsperson, were hanging out doing one day doing townsfolky things when your relative was tragically killled by Lord Evilguy and his evil followers, the Cult of Evil. You then gain magic powers and set out to kill Lord Evilguy and avenge your beloved <InsertRelativeNameHere>. There are a few other cutscenes along the way but they don't seem to tell us much we don't already know.Level design is also fairly straightforward - the entire game seems to be one long corridor with the occasional short sidepath, although it looks decent enough.The combat is clearly the meat of the game, but for me it just wasn't that interesting. A lot of people who like the game will claim that if someone doesn't like the combat, it's because they're 'doing it wrong' - they don't know how to combine spells properly and just throw the one fireball spell over and over. In my case I don't think that's true. I've seen the videos, I've read a couple of guides, I'm using the mastery and control spells, I'm using my blink and block, and I still dodn't find it terribly exciting.Generally, spells work best if you charge them up a bit, and it usually takes several spells to kill an enemy - at the very least, applying 'mastery' (which increases the power of subsequent hits) and/or a control spell before going for damage is normal. Combine with the fact that the game doesn't really require precision aim - the standard bolt spell actually homes in on enemies! - and combat felt a little sluggish to me.Compounding this is that there is a lot of combat, but all the enemies and environments seem to be basically the same. Once you've got your combos down, the only thing that brings any variety to combat is that enemies spawn with random 'affixes', similar to the unique monsters in games like Diablo or Path of Exile. This make choosing which enemies to prioritise important - which I assume is what they were aiming for, since there's not a huge emphasis on manual dexterity - but I didn't find it enough to prevent combat become repetitive fairly quickly. Some of the spell effects are pretty flashy if you like that sort thing, however.The other major part of the game is the crafting system, which is potentially interesting but more of a chore than it needs to be. Prepare to spend a lot of time on inventory management, because you're going to amass large piles of junk which you'll need to sort though using an interface which could be better. Again, it's not the worst but it could have been better. If you're really into min-maxing and comparing stats you'll probably love it, though.Overall I think this game is competent but underwhelming. It doesn't really have glaring faults, but I just couldn't get into it. If you love flashy special effects or complicated crafting systems and don't mind a bit of repetition you might get more out of it than I did."
