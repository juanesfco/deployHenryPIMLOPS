2016-09-11,17470,True,"DeadSpace_exe has stopped workingwindows 10 ples....[Update] I finally managed to boot this baby up, I'm a big Dead Space fan and I really recommend playing this seeing as it is one of the best horror games to date P.S if you are wondering how I fixed this problem I simply added a settings.txt file and then opened 'testapp' from within the main Dead Space directory, this some how booted it up, I hope this helps :)"
