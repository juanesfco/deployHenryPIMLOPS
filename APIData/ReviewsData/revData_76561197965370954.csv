They listen to players, patch the game often, put some new content free or really cheap (first paid dlc was 3â‚¬).The game is addictive, a bit repetitive but that's what makes it fun : the same maps, different events.Based A LOT on RNG it'll ask you a lot of time to get some items (they've balanced it with the shrine, it's much less random than at start)Go praise Sigmar and kill those filthy rats now."
