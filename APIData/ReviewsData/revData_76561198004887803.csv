This game is amazing, even if you do not like dungeon crawlers. Difficulty is perfectly appropriate and challenging and the character design and art is top-notch. It's quite disturbing but it fits the mood perfectly. The possible downsides to the game lie within how it is coded. Sadly, the game runs on Flash, ruling out use of the Steam overlay UI as well as lack of proper screen resolution support. This disadvantage is a mere point worth overlooking, especially when this game regularly goes on sale for $1.24.There is absolutely no excuse not to get it."
