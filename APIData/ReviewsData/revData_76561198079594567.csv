It's not just one song that plays over and over again, but a vary in soundtrack that keeps you engaged and excited. As for gameplay, this game is fast paced, action packed and forgiving. This game is perfect for people who have always wanted to let their emotions out through games. If you die, just restart, but angrier, that anger helps fuel the gameplay to it's best."
