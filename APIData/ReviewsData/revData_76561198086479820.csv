2015-09-12,227940,True,"From watching five of your fellow teammates be ripped to shreds beside you as you push forward, your aim staggering as you hear that cling, your M1 Garand firing it's eighth round to your MP40 clicking as it's final round of it's 32 bullet clip smashes through the head of an American. This game has that old classic fps feel to it, each man making a difference and it's so satisfying when all your team's individual actions match up, the tanks rolling forward with infantry support and air cover, light vehicles letting Infantry to keep up as they take the points. I love playing this game, although it's pay to win nature tends to be quite a turn off but nothing like the feeling of finally unlocking that weapon you have been saving up for."
