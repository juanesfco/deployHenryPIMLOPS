2014-12-23,264200,True,This game is amazingly fun. It does have a simple concept with simple commands but it is just so hard to put the mouse down. 10/10 would bang XD.
2014-06-25,105600,True,"Terraria is a fun game where the amount of things you can find, kill and make are almost endless. It can get a bit boring playing by yourself sometimes but with friends it makes the game 10X more better. One of my favorite things to do is go seaching underground for statues and bringing them back to my massive tree house I struggle to get up to myself. Great game 7/10"
