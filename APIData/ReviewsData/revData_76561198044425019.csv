2016-07-29,319630,True,"Absolutely beautiful game. While the ending might not be the best, the journey is incredibly awesome. Since Ep. 1 is free, you have no reason not to play it.9/10, wish I could play it again for the first time."

2015-10-21,405170,True,"It's pretty damn good DLC to be completely honest with you. The high detail on the car, and attention to detail with the sounds and visuals are amazing. For a BTTF fan this is a must have. However, it has no customisation whatsoever. That's a pretty big downer, but it's so good nonetheless, customisation would have just added the cherry to the top."
