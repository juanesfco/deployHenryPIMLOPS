(For example, Multiplayer, WOW!)I am a big fan of open-world survival game(+zombie apocalypse) and this game is  just great and I can gurantee that it willbecome even better and better with upcoming updates which are on a regular basis.Only the hard part for me were/are bugs and I think these bugs do not bother too much in terms of game progressing andI do understand it considering that it is stil an early access game.I assume this game has potential to become one of the best games in the genre(i personally think it already is)."
