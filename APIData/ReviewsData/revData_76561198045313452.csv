The Skill tree is very large and you can go anywhere with any class, the progression and class development is very flexible, by the end of the game you can be a FireRanger Tank if you felt like it!This game is by far my most Favourite Action RPG, I play it over TL2 or D3 anyday, and it's free! Give it a try, it will be worth your time if you call yourself a gamer!"
