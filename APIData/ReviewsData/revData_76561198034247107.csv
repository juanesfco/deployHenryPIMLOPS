2016-03-01,236390,False,Terrible flight game... mediocre shooter. There are different flight mechanics for different controller inputs making htis really just another point n' click adventure... with a fuel gauge.This could have been great but the handwavium approach to flight control makes it an FPS without cover.   Better off with Counterstrike.
2016-05-19,107410,True,Install the AI helper and C2 Command Mods... download DUWS Campaign ...Sell all my crappy Counterstrike fingerpaint guns...Never play another FPS... 
2016-04-24,359320,False,"So I came into this game full of hope and high expectations: the game delivered on all of them.However, the community did not: if you enjoy brigading, biased moderators and a generally smug, passive-aggressive PvE crowd that will go out of their way to shutdown any remotly PvP inclined interaction then this is the game for you.  There is no Player versus Player piracy, bounty hunting or combat in general short of highly organized and rather drab league play: nothing dynamic and engaging.Basically this is a Space Trucking and Tourism Sim"
2016-03-21,252950,False,"if you can get past the player base being a bunch of squeeker kids(or the same in quasi-adult bodies) its fun.Suggest first move is mute everyone... consistently irritating people.Aside form that great game.EDIT:  Changed to negative due to total lack of action on community managment.  Reporting chat,  names and avatars promoting neo-nazism, serial killers, rapists and other such bile is ignored. This game is itching for a lawsuit."
2016-03-17,301520,False,Classic example of poorly managed feature creep; the developers started with a great idea and shoud have known when to polish the existing assets then leave it alone and move onto a new project.  They didn't and now it is a cluttered over engineered mess.EDIT: after last patch; uninstalled and forgotten
2015-01-06,214490,True,"Having never been a fan of so called 'horror' games I approached Alien: Isolation with a hefty dose of skepticism, expecting the usual 'jack in the box' enemy appears mechanics and irritating pervasive darkness + flashlight navigation.I was amazingly, happily surprised.  This is the first game I have actually been afraid of.I work late in my building and used to leave in almost total darkness... down five floors through service entrances/exits.  Thanks to playing this game after hours I now leave with all the lights on... quite a shock for a man in his mid-30s.Buy this, it is fantastic.EDIT:  Only played on the Hardest difficulty... should only be played on the Hardest difficulty.  The AI is tweaked way higher and it feels more like the movies."
