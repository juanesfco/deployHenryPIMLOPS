2015-03-22,730,True,"Counter-Strike still remains my favourite Multiplayer FPS series. Global Offensive took CSS and added a more up-to-date competitiveness to it. Even though the new Rank system is the worst thing they could have possibly added to Counter Strike in my opinion, you can always go back and play Source or 1.6 if your looking for a more casual experience.8.5/10 ~ Has chickens, molotovs and Dak Dak's but with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mainstream ranking system."
