2015-06-05,239220,False,if this is the kindof game you want go play diablo 3 (which in my opinion is much better gameplay wise).
2014-11-02,301520,True,This game is pretty awesome but you have to pay to be premium with their own curencey which is rounded of most of the time but it is fun and annoying but I can get over it
2016-03-06,208090,True,A hilarious and graphic third person shooter with an amzing weapons creation engine. no two people have the same gun.
2015-07-15,22330,True,It's not the best open world game but it is a fine game with plent of story.

2015-06-05,221260,True,this game is fun and you must BURN EVERYTHING of course to get money to buy more things rince and repeat.
2014-01-15,440,True,This game has the potential to be great yet does need some inprovements but it always and will be awesome but still when you play (SPOILER ALERT) mannup mode be careful of the annoyences of other players on your team (who cares about the robots)
