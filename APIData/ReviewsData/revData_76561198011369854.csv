2015-02-13,299860,True,its sad really i think the idea is good i mean dino's and zombie's and people but they really need to work on the crafting menu and the looting system bodys should be lootable and cant open peoples crates which is sad and then dino's and zombies hit boxes they hit you from anywhere when you engage them it needs to be when there looking at you only so you can dodge and out move them to get the kill the building is fine but needs a graphic increase more detail  i think if they can do this game will be great
