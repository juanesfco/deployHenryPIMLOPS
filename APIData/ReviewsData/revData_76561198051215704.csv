2014-02-10,203160,True,This is the best game I have ever played (i have played the last of us) This game needs to recieve more love. It is so emotional and the Story is amazing and I cannot stop thinking about it. I give it a 9/10. I no the last of us recieved a 10/10 but that is increibly high for it because the gameplay was so short. This game gives a on_going rush and you cannot wait for what is going to happen.
