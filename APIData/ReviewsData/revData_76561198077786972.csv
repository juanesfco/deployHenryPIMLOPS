2016-03-28,291550,True,"im not great at this game but wow can i reck noobs.So Brawlhalla is a really good brawl  em up/ super smash bro type game. For everyone i knew and recommended it to( and actually played the game) all of them liked it.All of the other games that try and recreate this fail. Brawlhalla is a game which i cannot write a good review about.Damn me, back at it again with the brawler games.why do i still write bad reviews."
