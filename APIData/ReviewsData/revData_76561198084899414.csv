The only complaint I have is that the items are very limited although that is understandable seeing as the game is in beta, I am looking foward to future updates.Also for some reason if i try running the game from my desktop instead of from steam it crashes and I can't open it without restarting my computer.Edit: Now I can't open the game at all. I don't know if it's just my computer or other people are getting this problem. If so please fix as soon as possible."
