2014-04-02,265930,True,"Goat simulator is a laugh,Its basicly a mix between skate 3 and grandtheft auto!If you enjoy mindless runing around headbuting summoning the inner goat loard and destroying a little town, Then this game is for you. Will lead you to an what am i doing right now? And what for? But then you contuine doing it becuase you have forgoten about your life as it seems.. So you continue to headbut cars and lick rocks and fly through the air.. I enjoy it and im sure you will 2 for 10 dollars its worth it you can enjoy it and so can your gf. Swing anyone ago becuase getting the highscore can take a little bit  ahah"
