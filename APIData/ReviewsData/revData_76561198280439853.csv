2016-03-04,359320,True,What can i say but WOW this is everything i wanted in a space game.The game can drag at times and the travel can become a bit tedious but the battles and cargo jobs pay off the longer you play.a bit slow to work your way up the ranks but thats life.if you are looking for a fast paced shoot em up this maybe is not for you but if your willing to put hours ( yes hours if you start a job you have to play till you are done)this is your game.9++ out of 10: )
