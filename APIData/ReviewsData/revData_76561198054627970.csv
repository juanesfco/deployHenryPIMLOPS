2014-10-06,17460,True,Ok mass effect well its hard to say what I like about this game but what I can say about the intire expirence in a whole I love this game i am on my third play through right now and again this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. I persononally say this game is worth every penny but I suggest you wait until ME 1 and 2 are on sale becausae once you finish this one you will want to play the second and third. The reason I havent gone into detail is because you need to buy this game for yourself and play it. I am The Radish and this is my favorite game on steam.

2013-12-28,208200,True,"Let me just change this review it was a bad review before now its a good one it turns out it was my computers fault but this game is great the graphics are meh the gunplay/gameplay is fun it kinda has a intresting plot if bother to follow it and playing the classic dooms is just great seriously just go ahead and buy this if you enjoyed Doom 1,2 and 3 and the dlc with it but probly wait until its on sale cause this doesent really improve much. I would give this a 7/10."
