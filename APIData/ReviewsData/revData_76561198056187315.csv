2015-11-16,332500,True,"From what little time ive played on it, Ive got to say im impressed. For an early access game, it far surpassed my expectations. Have no problems with the game whatsoever, as what I do find slightly weird, if most likely just because it is in early access.(Mobs have really weird behaviours) All in all 10/10"
2014-02-13,230410,True,"Well i have played this game to death and still havent done everything. over 660 hours played, Good third person shooter that is constantly improved/updated"
2014-10-16,1250,True,Someone buy this for me.
2014-04-07,570,True,Addicted to this game. Cant stop playing. Play all day every day.
2016-04-27,235460,True,"Ninja Cyborg that slices people, cyborgs and giant robots into pieces with swords. 10/10 would listen to cyborg talk about memes again."
2015-09-06,730,True,"Would be a great game, easily 9/10, except it hates all Australian players. You want to get a game with people who speak english and dont yell at you in languages you dont understand?  Too bad. Living in Australia means that every single game Im matched with people who dont even speak english, and there is nothing i can do about it. They say you should just team up with mates, yea that would be great, IF I COULD MEET ANY THAT COULD SPEAK ENGLISH. If they added a filter to choose whether you want to play on regional servers, i would probably play this game a hell lot more, except at this point im abandoning games because I cant communicate with my team. Currently rate this game å››/10"
2014-01-10,221100,True,Its a pretty good game so far although there are definitely some bugs. Found ways to see thru walls and interaction pop-ups not always workingDied from falling down a ladder because it wouldnt let me climb down
2014-01-02,43160,True,This was a fun game that i would like to play more of but i might play the first one first. Ending really sucks as i wanted to see what happens to the Dark Ones but oh well. Maybe there will be a number 3
2013-11-27,49520,True,"Is a good game when u have nothing else to do. Although, it can get boring after a while but there a SO MANY DLC's and i got no money to buy dem so im stuck with the original :("
