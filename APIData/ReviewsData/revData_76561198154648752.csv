Kills made by explosives will mostly torn your character into pieces, and usually the extremities will the ones getting off the bodies, arms legs, sometimes the head or half torso, etc. There's too much detail. The little isssue is when someone is getting shot there's gonna be a lot of blood splatting per hit, most games would make the blood be spilled and stay on the surfaces, this game doesn't do much of that, but it's that much of an issue.The combat skills such are TIER 1 and TIER 2 in most characters are fitting on science fiction and real science, such as optical cloak (this is an example) is not necessarily accurate due the movility would disturb this ability; you can 'download' the TIER 1 version of the team mate if they use a TIER 2 skills, it's temporal and weaker but still near similar to the original character whom you downloaded the TIER skill, works as long as you're near host of the TIER skill and up to 3 other players that are not you.There's currently two female ressembling characters on this game.I could say more of this, but I think this is enough for now, this game is great for casual play or competitive play if it gets further such as having a competitive community, it has the potential for it.I give it 10/10 shooter game with science fiction and covert arts."
