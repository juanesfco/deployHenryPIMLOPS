2013-12-01,212680,True,"FTL is a strategy game set in space, and what a game it is. Before you begin, you get to choose either Easy or Normal difficulty. While these don't sound relatively menacing, in a regular game these equate to Extremely Hard and Impossible difficulties. During the game, you take on the role of a captain of a spaceship and will usually fail horribly at it. But sometimes you won't. Sometimes you will get to the Last Stand (with a great deal of hope and lots of preparation), telling yourself that you will win and everything will turn out fantastically. 2 minutes later, you will admit a soul-crushing defeat and begin crying on your bed. When you stop crying, you will play this game over and over again and you will love every minute of it, because this game is absolutely brilliant. So if you have a soul, and it is due for a bit of crushing, buy this game. If you don't have a soul, buy this game anyway. You will not regret it."
