2012-11-17,380,True,I want to recommend this game to all of the users of steam that have hl2 so you should get it. It also comes with a new zombie called the zombine which is a combine zombie. If you have garrys mod it gives you the magnusaun skin but the zombine skin is untextured. But all in all i think this is a good game so get it.
