2016-07-15,233860,True,"One of the hidden gems of steam, this rare greenlight success story stands as proof that amongs the sea of greenlit garbage, there still exist some quality titles.I would urge anyone who has been scarred by the early-access system not to be afraid. I've owned this game since 2013 back when there were only ~three types of armor with similar graphics and few features of note. It somehow managed to be surprisingly fun then, and it has only gotten better since. The dev('s) put out updates often and the game has undergone fundamental changes since 2013. The squad system, the new worldmap, the new factions, the overhaul of equiptment (eg. the armour I mentioned earlier) - all these things have changed since then and every one of these changes, though I often initially missed the old ways, were for the better.Some will say a sandbox game which has been in early access alpha for two years is neccesarily a lost hope. This game proves otherwise.The game is still a little laggy and may run slow on older rigs, it also occasionally crashes, though the rate of these has fallen drastically since '13.I strongly reccomend this game to anyone interested in a vast, open-world survival RPG where it is the player who creates his/her own story."
