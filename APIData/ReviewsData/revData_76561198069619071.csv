2014-10-11,241260,True," 6/10 TL;DR: Great visuals, very immersive soundtrack, unique detective concepts. No main-storyline, no ending. Puzzles were way too easy. Cases are predictable. This game honestly took a huge step back from The Testament in terms of storyline, but a huge leap forward in gameplay.Great visuals, Baker Street/Whitechapel has greatly improved over The Testament. Voice acting is well done (accents), but lip-syncing is pretty disappointing for next-gen gaming. Very unique game mechanics with new interesting concepts like Imagination and Sherlock Talent. The only downside to these is that the game tells you directly where your targets are, which just kills the fun. It'd be better if the Sherlock Talent just gave the game a filter or texture that makes it easier to see objects of interest, rather than make them glow.6 in-depth very intriguing, however, very predictable cases. It's a great improvement over The Testament, which was more like an interactive movie. This game allows you to not only make your own deductions, but make your own conclusions, choose your own guilty party and make your own moral choices as to how you will covict them. No main storyline (except for  The Merry Men terrorist group  ), which is HUGELY disappointing, especially in a Sherlock adaptation. I loved how The Testament was all one case and was full of plot twists and in depth dialogue and story. Overall, this game feels half-finished but  is definitely worth your time  if you are into the more thinking-based games that require your full attention/patience."
2014-04-12,219640,True," 7/10 EDIT: As of the most recent update, there is no loading/setup bugs and the interface has improved significantly. Now has more Australian ping-friendly servers, uses up a lot less CPU.TL;DR: Great visuals, very individual, bit buggy, ♥♥♥♥ community, very unique, WORTH PLAYING!Been playing this game for a while now and I have high hopes for the full-version. The loading times and setup however is pretty ♥♥♥♥-poor. I've spent 16 hours in-game, most of which are probably spent joining servers and loading up the game. The graphics/animations were nice. Original textures and decal, detailed landscapes and maps. Animations are mostly consistent. It has a unique fighting engine, having an anatomical damage-system instead of the normal health based system, like the Overflow indie engine. The physics are a bit off, seeing a lot of bugs and glitches here and there but that's okay for a game still in it's beta stage. Controls were fairly simple, hard to pickup but very satisfying when I got the hand of it. The community at times can be painful to put up with, witnessed first hand on many accounts people taking over servers and changing the game-modes (Free-duels to FFA). Full of obnoxious kids ignoring game rules, leaves me exiting the game frustrated every time. I only bother with higher level servers, although I don't fit that criteria, is the only games that have players who give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the quality of gameplay. I'm sure there will be a more in depth story-line to come in the future, but for now it's not fair to hold the game against it."
