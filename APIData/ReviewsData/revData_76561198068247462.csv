2015-03-06,345650,True,Short visual novel....yes.At some parts i felt really sad for Vinity (the main character) especially when the music sounded sad.The art style is just beautiful in my eyes and this deserves a sequel no matter how bad people think this is.And the fact that it's free just makes me more happy thank you InvertMouse.
