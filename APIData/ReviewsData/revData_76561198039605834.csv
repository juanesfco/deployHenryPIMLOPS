Combat is very precise and very rarely feels cheap or unfair. There is large game world with many interesting and breathtaking environments that are filled with a wide variety of enemies from grotesque monsters to heavily armoured warriors.I also liked the multiplayer aspect. Seeing shadows of other players, interacting with their bloodspots on the ground to see how they died, getting summoned to another world to help slay a boss, and getting invaded by other players. PVP battles are incredibly tense, the tactics that worked on NPCs don't always work with players, and you know that the oponent you facing is no novice gamer. Perhaps not as revolutionary as Dark Souls 1 but it's still a very challenging and enjoyable experience that I thoroughly enjoyed.9/10. Death is just the beginning"
