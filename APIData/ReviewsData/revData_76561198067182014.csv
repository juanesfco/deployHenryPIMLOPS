2014-08-01,304930,True,"This game is nothing short of amazing! It has an interesting graphics style, plenty of loot, good mechanics and fun enemies. The only downside is that there is not a huge amount of content to play with and the bugs. I know this game is in early alpha and it is amazing, but there are some bugs that are sometimes simply annoying, while others are nearly game-breaking.I'd give this game a 8/10. It is definitely worth playing.-It's been updated and is no longer half as good as it was. D;"
2014-06-22,70,True,"New ReviewOkay, I hated on this game before I had fully experienced it. This game is VERY FLAWED. Nevertheless, it is still a good game. Many of the areas are confusingly laid out and some of the puzzle solutions are stupid. Still, the general gameplay is decent and for fans of Half Life 2 this is a must get."
2014-05-16,221100,False,"I have wanted this game for so long now I decided I would try it. That was a HUGE mistake. This game as horrible AI, GUI, inventory, lag and pretty much everything else. I know they say it is only in Alpha but a game should at the very least be playable before they release it. The game looks, sounds and feels like someone got bored and decided to slap together this thing in under 3 hours. Should you get it? If you want to waste your time and money."
2014-02-24,224260,True,"Really Good for a free game. Actually Brlliant for a free game. I would pay money go get this. It is a brilliant zombie shooter for both slow and fast paced shooter action. I recommend to anybody who likes Zombies, FPS's, horror,multiplayer shooters and just good games. :P"
