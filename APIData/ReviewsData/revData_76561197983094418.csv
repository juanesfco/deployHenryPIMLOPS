2015-03-28,319630,True,"First review for a video game. Other than Bastion / Child of Light it just hasn't felt worth it for orher games.I've played many hours of many video games, hundreds in some, thousands in others. The few hours I spent playing Episode 1 and 2 of this game moved me enough to write a review. I'll keep this as TL:DR as possible.This game will make you fall in love with games and remind you that they are a platform for art just as much as books/comics/movies/tv.People will make comparisons to the Telltale Games series. Genre and mechanics are similar, but very refreshingly different in all other aspects.PROS:-Incredibly in-depth, immersive and changeable storyline-Unpredictable-Best soundtrack of any game ever-Characters you actually care about-Ability to take back your initial choices, but be forced to live with the consequences of your final decisions-See if you made the same choices as the rest of the world after playing through an episode-Stunning, smooth and in-depth visuals-Voice acting is top-notch-A world you will love to lose yourself in-So many feelsCONS:-Trailer gives away too much-Lip-synching and facial expressions do not align with the dialogue a lot of the time, has the unfortunate side-effect of reminding you you're playing a game-Many will find the episodes too short, personally I found them perfectly timed.-Waiting for the next episode is painful, like Game of Thrones painful-In the 'previously on' sequence at the start of Episode 2, you are shown the pivotal moments from the last episode, but not the pivitol decisions you made in those moments - a sorely missed opportunity.-You will most likely be left with a sense of melancholy aimlessness after playing, because nothing can quite stack up to what you've just experienced. Have something simple and light-hearted on hand for post-play.10/10 - Would reverse time so I can buy and play again."
