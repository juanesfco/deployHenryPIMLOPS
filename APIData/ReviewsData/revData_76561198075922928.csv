2016-05-29,379720,True,I regularly ejaculate while playing this game.
2014-07-15,286040,True," I can honestly say if this is only early access, the next Doom game has some competition This game is REALLY good for early access. Like, REALLY good. First thing I noticed was the fact that thegraphics are incredible. At least for me, because I have a pretty powerful PC. The environment is VERY Doom 3-like, however I'd say the textures are much better looking. Everything else is exactly the samein terms of appearance.Gameplay-wise it is not as good. Walking is a bit floaty and you can't jump, as Space is the 'interact'button. Gunplay works really well however. While being slow to start off the game kicks you in thenuts with a big horde of zombies at the end of the first level. However while this pumps up the gamethe general gameplay is slow.Feature-wise it is very good. You can buy different items in the in-game shop with CREDITS YOU PICK UP IN-GAME. NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS. THANK JESUS HIMSELF. Anyways, the guns in thestore seem to be varied and they look very nice. Problems: - Had minor issues with menus over-lapping while running on my 3 monitors - No jumping - Slow gameplayWould I recommend it? YEP. Remember my comment about Doom 4 having some competition? Yeah, I was being truthful. I honestly think if the devs fix the slow gameplay, walking and lack ofjumping, this could be a classic that will be remembered for years to come.Doom, watch the f**k out.NOTE: I know I go on about how this is the next Doom-killer but I really think it has the potential to be."

It controls better than anything I've ever played, the guns are amazing, the enemies are adorable and varying and IT'S FRICKIN' FREE TO PLAY!!!!! IF YOU DON'T GET THIS GAME YOU SHOULD SEE A PSYCHIATRIST. Oh, it's also only 43 megabytes so there is NO excuse not to get this amazing production."
2015-07-06,2280,True,"It's ♥♥♥♥ing Doom mother ♥♥♥♥er. Buy it and blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of demons. Don't mistake my 9 mins of playtime in steam, I use external programs to run this game. I have 30+ hours in this game"
2015-07-06,307690,True,"Best open world game ever created, best plot ever concieved. I love this game so much I actually bought it twice. 11111/10 would sleep with a dog again"
2015-07-06,200260,True,♥♥♥♥ing perfect.
2015-07-06,107410,True,"Aside from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimisation and as lack of content to boot, modding makes this game so ♥♥♥♥ing worth your time. Much more accessible and polished than ArmA 2, with even better modding support and workshop enabled, this is a highly reccomended for me. Must have for any FPS lover, or anyone looking to get into mil-sim stuff."
