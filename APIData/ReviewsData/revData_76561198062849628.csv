2015-05-14,326410,True,"tl;dr It's like pirates tower defence naval combat sim with trading?I originally bought this game because someone compared it to Sid Meier's Pirates! but said the naval battles and city capturing were a lot better. That is definitely a true statement. If you want a complex strategy game with diplomacy and something new around every corner, this is not the game for you. The missions are thoroughly repetitive and if you like that style of gameplay, everything so far has felt like a long slow grind getting from one side of the map to the other. However, beating up pirates and trying to figure out how to win a naval battle against three pirates who are bigger and more badass than you is super fun and I have died a solid six or seven times in three hours of gameplay trying to take on an area or battle that was too much for me. I'd recommend playing co-op as it's a lot more fun to raid and plunder and fight for supremacy with a friend on the map - though character players feel OPd (if only because PCs can manoeuvre better), even in areas that i would think are meant to be a lot harder for you. All in all i'd give this game a solid 7/10.Pros:Naval battlesPiratesBlowing stuff upDoesn't require a ridiculous amount of thinkingCo-opCons:RepetitiveI cannot see the appeal in playing a diplomatic or trade based game (though I may change my mind when I need a lot more money)Graphics are eh"
