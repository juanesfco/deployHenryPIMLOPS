The default keybindings I found pretty terrible to be honest, and the game using Xbox controller key prompts made it all the more frustrating. After having played with a controller and changing the keys to my liking though, I have to say that I couldn't bring myself to go back to the controller.Dark Souls II has fairly decent graphics, but falls short of triple A releases. It makes up for that with a smooth 60 frames per second which is absolutely vital in a game like this which requires you to patiently learn enemies moves while dodging death by the breadth of a hair. Fortunately you don't need a beast of a PC to run it either, with my average (or below) set up of an AMD Radeon HD 6780 + four gigs of RAM I experienced maybe three or four frame drops through my ten characters.The game itself is really quite challenging. Casual gamers I'd imagine would have a hell of a time trying to adapt and I'd highly reccommend searching for the hidden attributes in some stats and what they fully affect, while Hardcore gamers will have plenty of room to trip up as well. Don't fret if the game feels too intimidating, failing is a large part of every Souls players first experience, it's the ecstacy in beating the jerk after your tenth try for some sweet revenge and coming back later in the game when you're more experienced to take the time to torture them.As far as Online Play goes... You'll find a lot of fantastic people willing to engage in jolly cooperation, but keep in mind that there are no rules in the Dark Souls universe, in a broken and decaying Kingdom it's every man for themselves and some people just want to watch the world burn."
