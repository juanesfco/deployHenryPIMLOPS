2014-06-20,206190,True,Gunpoint is an amazing game that takes stealth seriously. You get a gun... well if you shoot it gives you about 20 seconds until the cops arrive some enemys you cant take down. basically stealth is your only option. If you want a great stealth game with build your own level I would definately recommend it. 4 stars.
