This keeps the interest going for much longer then you would expect, and with it's multiplayer feature it is realy fun and enjoyable to pla with friends. This game get's a 15 out of 10! and i strongly recomend this game to anyone at all that want's a good experience that will stay with them for a very long time! (moding the game could ruin the experience of your playthrough. I know this because a very good friend of mine warned me about his mistake of adding item spawning mods into the game.)"

2014-04-16,239220,True,This game seeems very open but when you get tobuild your castle and you fly (drag) to the edge of the map it looks like a giant card board background. i would like the clouds to move not for it to look like that or at least make the wall largerand have a limit to where you can drag your view. Otherwise great game! ;)
