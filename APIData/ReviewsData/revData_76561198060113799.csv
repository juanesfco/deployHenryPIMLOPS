2015-07-09,72850,True,"The best game in the ''Elder Scrolls'' series!I really recommend it!The modding community is huge,with different types of mods,from graphics to armor and weapons mods.I like the game because the guards are keep saying:''I used to be an adventure like you,but I took an arrow to the knee''.The graphics are good...not the best but if you'll add an ENB....be sure you have a monster ''rig''.The storyline...Well the storyline in my opinion is the best in the entire ''Elder Scrolls'' series.I give a 10/10.Good work ''Bethesda''!And for the mod creators keep doin' those mods..because this game is awesome...but it gets boring at a time....                          So as I said 10/10!Great job!"
