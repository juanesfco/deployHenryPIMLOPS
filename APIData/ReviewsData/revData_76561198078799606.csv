2015-10-01,370240,False,"WARNING, DO NOT BUY!!! I don;t know if it's just me but the graphics on this games are just horrible, even when all graphical settings are on high. My beast gaming laptop goes beyond all the system requirements of this game, and (before i get all the hate for using a laptop) I play gta 5 constantly on 50+ FPS fully optimised. So ***WARNING TO ALL LAPTOP OR PC GAMERS: SPORTS GAMES ARE FOR CONSOLES, NOT COMPUTERS*** If you want to buy this game despite all the deserved hate, wait a few months until all the patches and bug fixed are released, please... I made the mistake of buying it on 2nd day of launch, exactly the same to when i pre-ordered arkham knight... (you know how that turned out). "
