2015-01-29,330840,False,"no i dont recommend until its on sale, the characteres are boring, game is boring, i know dramas like game of thrones take time to build up its characteres and settings but honstly, i found myself forced to play this game jsut because i love the show that much. What i hate most about telltale is that they take forever to dish out episodes ( 1 episode = roughly 46min -hr..there are 5 episodes..) srsly like every 2-3 months a new hour of play is ready ..camon and its not like the graphics are high detail anyway, any potato computer can run then again we are in 2015! telltale is srsly becoming one of my top hated companies becasue, thers no effort in visuals, characters, they milk any franchise they come across.. they are the EA of 'choose your own adventures' so to speak. sorry if this is unreadable i was drunk when i wrote this. Overall telltales sucks and need to get it together, some solutions can be to make the episodes longer and more choices the players can make, dont make a game where the gamer just wathces everything if i want to watch ill go to netflix. i am very very dissapointed and would be embarrased to work at telltale - rant over"

2016-04-09,311560,True,"Assasins creed rogue.. where to begin. This game is my favorite AND at the same time most hated ac game of the franchise. Rogue showed me that even some of the asasins creed's morals are to be questioned. anyway i absolutely loved this game even with its few flaws, some including, very short main campaign length, shays voice is absolutely annoying, and not enough side objectives. that being said the story was great, the game is a filler between ac3 and ac4 aswell as a prologue to ac unity. the unique weapons u got were very fun and were kinda op at times haha. hunting asasins never felt so good even though they are tought( ie they can stealth in brush, more alert than regular ai, use smoke and pistols too well). the game is also the most optimized video game on pc to date, becasue it was intended for old consoles unlike unity which were made for the new console generation. everything was perfect though if you count out shays annoying as voice, short story however it left me confused as to which side i rather like now, assasins or templars. imagine this, would u want donald trump(templars) running the country or having a purge anarchy libertarianism type government where everyone is free to do their own will(think about it carefully)....i recommend the game but dont expect to be playing it for too long"
2016-04-06,242050,True,"One of the best ac games although more of a pirate sim than its traditional hunt,stalk,kill gameplay. ac blackflag has so much to do with its huge open world, filled with contracts,upgrading ur ship, upgrading kenways gear, hunting for easter eggs, assasinations. With all that being said it does get a bit repetitive so only play with breaks inbetween. As for story i thought it was a but weak, it does get better later on but just slightly. graphics are amazing, sound is amazing. Ai is extremely weak in this game, sneaking is easy, infact u can walk in plane sight almost haha. overall solid story, kinda predictable, great graphics, repetitive for long durations, graphic heavy gpu is needed. 7/10"
