2015-03-28,8930,True,"F*ck this game is beautiful. Sure it looks like another strat but the amount of detail brought into the games is mind blowing. The DLC is just as immense, it adds pure and fresh interesting maps for example the Earth map that is geologically accurate to the one your standing on. New leaders that you can use to your advantage. Plus Ghandi (NO JOKE) is your enemy from day one. He will be friendly as stated in real life but theres a bug in his programming that makes him the destroyer of world's. Be very careful with him. Five turn's at Ghandi'sRate: 10/10"
