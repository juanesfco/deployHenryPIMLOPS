2014-06-28,246090,True,"Its promising.While yes, the AI is buggy almost to the point of hilarity and yes, your success or failure seems to hinge on wether or not you get a certain bug (my favourite was the security member who floated outside an airlock and waited until they suffocated), the game certainly has promise.I can't wait to play it as its closer to being complete. I look forward to taking the chance that a derilict station that has just shown up will in fact contain raiders, and having my builders knock out a wall section to make them all suffocate first. Of course I also did that to a station containing friendlies and felt a little guilty :)"

2013-12-30,243950,True,"It's Civ style map strategy, with the battles optionally fought through RTS, but instead of the normal arial camera, you get to fly about as a dragon and light stuff on fire!Of course there's the politics in between fights and I often found myself thinking 'why are you bothering me, i'm a dragon, leave me alone so i can burn things', but it certainly did add to the game while satirising real world politics and ideologies.I'm not much of an RTS fan but this was fun."
