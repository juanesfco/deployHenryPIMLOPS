2015-09-20,222880,True,I find it way more enjoyable than some of the big budget games like C.O.D and Battlefield.Especially since there arn't any 6 years olds screaming how many times the '♥♥♥♥ed' my mum
2014-10-20,227940,True,"Heros and Generals is a really good game for anyone that is intersted in the war or fps games.The only downside is that most players will end up joining the Germans side making it a lot harder to find games. Good textures and sound effects, but has a few bugs and kinks but ither than that its a pretty good game.8/10"
