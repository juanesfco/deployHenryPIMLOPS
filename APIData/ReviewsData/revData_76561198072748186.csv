2014-12-17,24740,False,Bad Performance Issues Non Original IdeaDifferent From Other Game In It SeriesWas Great Game On The 'PSP' But I Thought The Experience Was Different. The Open Map Idea From 'Need For Speed' But I Personally Burnout Series I saw was much different from NFS. I Like the Old Modes On The Burnout Like Rampage Which Was Always Fun. Also The Multiplayer Was Almost Existent Since Last Time I Played. Think You Still Can Find This Game In A Cheap Bundle.
