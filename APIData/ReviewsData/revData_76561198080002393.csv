2016-06-05,411830,False,I had a good time playing the game while it lasted.I really tried my best to cope with the constant crashes every now n than however i couldnt take it.So i decided to reboot my computer hoping it would work but it made it worse.I cant even load the game and play it.Others are having this problem as wellJust pray when you buy this game you arent the ones who have this problem
