2015-08-19,348960,True,I loved this game completed it in around 2-3 days. I was dissapointed in this as I didn't have much time to 'connect' with the game as its only around 4 hours long. Odysseus: Long Way Home is a hidden-object game with a few other puzzle's included. The graphics wern't bad and the cutscene's made great screenshot opportunities. The hidden object scene's were fairly challenged but it got a bit repetative. I found the puzzle's  a little challenging and fun but there wasn't as much as I'd hoped there was. This is a great game to pass the time when you have nothing to do.
