2013-07-16,202170,False,Could of been a lot better then what it was. I got this at release and with all the ♥♥♥♥ that went on with it the giving of DLCS the taking away of DLCS the every update used to currupt your game file so you couldnt use it after update. Man massive let down donno how it is now though? If fixed most things would be awesome but after re starting the game 4 full times i say no no. 4/10
