2013-10-20,250320,True,This game or interactive story as one might call it is truly remarkable. All though only one episode has been released I was already drawn into the world of the Fables and felt a genuine connection to each charcter I met. The choices you have to make really help you shape how you want Bigby (the main character) to act and be viewed by others. Do you tear off this monsters arm thats been attacking you or walk away .Do you go to one destination before another possibly leading to unknown consequences. I loved this decisions and am interseted to see where they take me in future episodes. 9.5/10
