2014-02-19,55230,True,I love how the game brings your attaetion in like gta 5 and the mount of missions will keep you entertained for weeks or even mouths of intense gaming you can alos play co op with a friend and play wored mode wich is really sruvival but not zombies like call of duty I highly recommend for those who like the gta type thing but want something differant
2016-07-25,377160,True,"i really enjoy the fallout series for multiple reasons 1. a open world post nuclear game is exciting (well at least when the idea was first created) i was really pumped to play fallout 3 when i got my first game platform PS3 i played the whole game twice on that and then moved to PC and had heaps of fun with modding. that alone chugged in heaps of hours especially my modded playthroughs in new vegas. i did go back and played the series again from the very first fallout game and was impressed not because of the game play but the story and that made me play every fallout game not all on steam but i did and enjoyed it all 2. the story to the whole thing is amazing even in fallout 4 it kept me entertained for a few years and still does today i just hope that bethesda can continue this and keep up the good work story wise 3. modding. this made fallout 3, fallout new vegas, fallout 4 replayable for even more hours on end i have spend 200+ hours on new vegas with mods im not sure about fallout 3 because it did not count my hours for some reason but oh well and now on fallout 4 im about to dive into my first modded playthrough and cant wait to get startedbut the thing that threw me off in fallout 4 vanilla wise was what bethesda said about the game being al about rpg and survival and all of that ♥♥♥♥ but it really wasnt and the small map was a big let down to me and reduced the replayability for me but i still have things to do in the game so ill still keep going with it. although these let downs with fallout 4 i still loved the game if your looking for story and modding this game is definatly worth a buy"
