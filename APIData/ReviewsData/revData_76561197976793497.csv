2016-07-21,65930,False,Command System is unwieldly. Somewhat unplayable.Not worth the time.

2015-03-14,263700,False,"This is a poorly executed clone of Super Crate Box. The graphics are polished, but the platforming is clunky garbarge.The enemies seem too easy, but when you die it feels cheap and undeserved.  Soo meh."
