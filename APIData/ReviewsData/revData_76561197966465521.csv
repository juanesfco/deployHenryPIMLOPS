2016-08-02,211820,False,"Not as fun as it could be. The weapon switch delay is frustrating, even if it is 'fair'. Weapon feel is off, hitboxes seem wrong.The way tooltips open partially offscreen. The grappling hooks are enticing, but crippled. Some of the boss fights are stiff, frustrating, grindy. The difficulty curve is too steep in places. Tech progression is scarce."

2015-02-07,323320,True,"Good, stress-free fun. It's nice to play a game so kinetic, rather than 'who's got the biggest numbers'. Just needs an elastic grappling gun."
