Sure there are some minor issues in gameplay but the soundtrack, voice acting and character arcs are the most powerful aspects of this game . It reaffirms my preference for video games over TV/cinema as a story telling media . So if you do play video games, I think you should at least try the first episode! 10/10. PS - don't binge play all the episodes, give your poor self a break. You'll thank me for it."
