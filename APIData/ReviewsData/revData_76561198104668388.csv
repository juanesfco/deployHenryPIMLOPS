2014-11-20,200210,False,"A while ago this was one of, if not the best online flash game I had ever played. You would be so engrossed in grinding items with the one fear of losing it all because your computer would lag when you spammed your 'Escape to Nexus' key.However once Kabam took over, the game has lost its touch. Although there are many new aspects that have been added to the game, such as new dungeons, weapons, pets, I feel that the cons outweigh the pros.Too much stuff has become purchasable, enemy and item spawn rates have been dramatically decreased. Worst of all the highest tier weapons have become untradable. The only way to get them is to grind them (which now takes 100 times as long) or use your money to get them directly, or speed up the process. This of course is stupid as you will probably lose all the items anyway, resulting in a waste of money.All in all this once amazing, rage-inducing, time-wasting game that 99.99% of people who played it enjoyed has gone from F2P to P2W. I'm sure 99.99% of people who play it now would agree with me that this game has become worse since Kabam took over."
