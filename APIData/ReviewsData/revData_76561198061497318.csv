2016-01-03,730,False,Ranking system is ♥♥♥♥ed. Only get this game is you want to play something else other than competitive or don't care about your rank.
2016-08-31,311210,True,"This review is ENTIRELY my opinion and is supposed to be informative.SINGLEPLAYERThe singleplayer of Black Ops 3 is so incredibly boring it makes me want to fall asleep. I'm only Rank 6/25 (or something like that), but it's a waste of time. All the single-player camos are boring and bad, so it's not even worth it for the camos. If you're looking for a singleplayer experience, this NOT it.ZOMBIESZombies is a classic Treyarch gamemode first introduced in World at War, and even after Black Ops 1 & 2, this is still incredible.. WITH THE SEASON PASS. I cannot stress enough that Zombies is completely useless if you don't have the season pass. Zombies only has 1 MAP w/o the season pass, which is a bit ridiculous, but regardless, if you DO end up getting the season pass, it's well worth it. There are in-depth easter eggs in every single map, with great detail and attention to the story. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A ZOMBIES EXPERIENCE, DO NOT BUY W/O SEASON PASS!MULTIPLAYERMultiplayer is probably the most popular gamemode of the 3, but is a bit of a broken mess. The controller support in this game is so incredibly infuriating it makes me want to leap off of a building, and the aim assist is the cause of the problem (instead of having a rant about why the aim assist is so ♥♥♥♥ed, I'm going to continue). The season pass for Black Ops 3 on PC for Multiplayer only is probably the biggest waste of money ever, as nobody plays the DLC after a few days of release. Though they have started to intergrate the DLC maps into the normal map pool, it's still a bit of a waste.SUPPLY DROP RANT / END OF MULTIPLAYER SEGMENTSupply drops are the worst thing to happen to Call of Duty ever. Activision has ♥♥♥♥ed over all Call of Duty games since Advanced Warfare (which I got ♥♥♥♥ing VAC'd on) with micro-transactions, or 'COD Points'. These COD Points can be used on Extra camos and Supply Drops (as of 1/9/16 [D/M/Y]). Supply drops are basically CSGO cases, but instead of getting one item, you get 3 (but you can actually trade in CSGO unlike this game). Supply drops can be earned in-game with Cryptokeys (which can be acquired by playing the game), and you have the choice of a Common Supply Drop, or a Rare Supply Drop. Only Rare Supply Drops can be bought with COD Points, and Rare Supply Drops give you a better chance for rare items. There are probably around 25 of them right now, with half of them being Melee Weapons. It's extremely rare to get these items with Common Supply Drops. And this is the part that pisses me off the most. YOU CAN GET DUPLICATES. Duplicates can be burned for more Cryptokeys, with Common being burned for 1 Cryptokey, Rare being burned for 3 Cryptokeys, Legendaries being burned for 7 Cryptokeys and Epic's being burned for 10 Cryptokeys. So if you get a Black Market weapon you already have.. well then ♥♥♥♥ you, because you can only burn it for 10 or 7 cryptokeys. The gameplay in multiplayer is OK and the community is toxic (you might want to rebind some keys). If you're looking for a multiplayer only experience, I would recommend buying the multiplayer starter pack (which only includes multiplayer and some restrictions, but you can upgrade to the full game whenever).I would NOT recommend this game if you are a veteran at Call of Duty, because the 'Exos' are ridiculous.OVERALLCall of Duty: Black Ops III is an OK game with great developers working on a terrible PC port. I can't help but feel that this platform (PC) is a third-wheel to the COD franchise, with every year having terrible PC ports and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance. If you're in it for the gameplay, buy the Multiplayer Starter Pack, if you don't like it, then refund it, if you like it, upgrade and buy the full game.I would rate this game 8/10 on consoles, since it's not so bad bugs & performance wise, but this is PC.I rate this game 7/10 (with Season Pass).I rate this game 5/10 (without Season Pass)."
2015-06-04,333930,True,"Guy got mad at me for not completing an objective, shortly after that, the server crashed. 10.5/10. Best game."
2015-04-13,271590,True,Give me a reason NOT to say this game is 10.5/10.
2015-12-04,225540,True,"Possibly one of the best free-roam games I've ever played.If you enjoy open world, beautiful scenery, explosions and wing-suiting, this game is definitely for you.Positives and Negatives (In My Experience [20> hrs])POSITIVE• Amazing graphics• A lot of content (I've played 22hrs and only have completed 44%)• Like Just Cause 2, but improved to make traveling in the air easier.• Easy vehicle controls (in my opinion)• Amazing soundtrack• A really interesting and original upgrade system, toggle on and off the upgrades you've unlocked.• Challenges actually have a purpose, linking to the upgrade system, doing a certain challenge gives you gears, which are your upgrade points, they separate to Destruction, Explosives, Weapons, Tether, Traversal, Land, Air & Sea Vehicles. Which like I mentioned before, are all able to be toggled on and off, which is neat.NEGATIVE• A kind-of rough launch (AMD Issues, Lock-on Missiles Glitch, etc.) [Restart Game to Fix Lock-on Missiles]• A decent story, not the best story I've ever played at all, 25 missions in total. (Yes, I completed the story)• Again with the story, there isn't really a connection between the player and the other characters.  Example (SPOILER) ~ When Dimah dies, I didn't feel sad at all, and wasn't really satisfied with killing the general.Overall, this is an amazing game with an ehh story. If you're only interested in the story, I would just watch a walkthrough,the story really isn't worth the 60$.OVERALL ~ 8/10"
2014-09-15,270550,True,"Yet Another Zombie Defense. Great game, but sometimes gets repetative, however. This game is probably one of the best Zombie Defences out there, I was gifted this by a friend and I liked it, only played half an hour though due to being a bit repetative, but it's alright. I mean, if you get the trading cards you could sell them for money and earn profit, but I would only recommend this if you would like a 30mins-1hr time waste. 6.5/10"
