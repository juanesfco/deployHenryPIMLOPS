2016-04-18,372000,False,"If you ever wanted proof beyond a doubt that this game was developed on the wrong side of the border in Korea; You just have to try Tree of Savior, where everything under the sun is locked down. I am pretty sure this is not IMC's first MMO rodeo but to hold the community to ransom due to 'Gold Traders' and thereby remove the Massively out of MMO is not conducive nor giving them any points. Live everyday thinking how the spiritual successor could have been better then move on to something else ( come back a year after F2P and see if things have settled). ATM you are paying EA to get stonewalled as you level further."
2016-04-24,230410,True,"DID YOU REALLY THINK?! IT WOULD BE THIS EASY ... to get a 75% off Platinum Discount voucher as a log-in reward?Warframe has evolved ever since its early beta days. Combat-wise. everything has been overhauled and feels fluid and seamless. A joy to experience.I have to tell you though, if you are a new player, you will suffer unless you are willing to slog through or be a wallet warrior (initially); To get those mods, weapons and frames to sustain your play through and serve as the foundation to farm everything else. For a free to play game, there are no paywalls, most things can be grinded, there is however a time wall, frames for instance take up to three days to build from individual components ( not counting the time to craft and farm them). But is par for the course, you can rush with in game Platinum ( that you spend real money to get). They have to get your cash somewhere.Some tips: I have to highlight this to new players especially since many fall into this trap:THERE  IS PLAYER TO PLAYER TRADING, SAVE YOUR PLATINUM FOR THATThe only thing you should spend IRL money/Platinum get in store is cosmetics that you really like, for everything else you can almost certainly advertise in Trade Chat.If you do try out Warframe and get over the initial hump: join an established clan to get access to dojo weapons, be prepared to grind void for the fortnightly Baro visits, enjoy the story missions, and follow in game lore to find out what you are in the 'Second Dream'.With that, see you in game, Tenno.  PS: Did I mention Corpus is the most annoying faction you will ever have the displeasure to come across?"
2015-09-24,391540,True,I haven't been so emotionally attached caring for the well-being of in game characters for a long time. This is a well crafted story and game and I whole heartedly thank the developer for creating such a wonderful experience.Totally above and beyond recommended for you and anyone you care about to experience!
