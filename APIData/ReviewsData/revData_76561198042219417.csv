This in itself was pretty cool. I kept looking for trees to cut and bushes to smash until i came upon a group of cannibals. They kept distance, until I entered the water. They ran at me, knocking me and battering me, until I took at 2 or 3 of the squad. As they fell, the other cannibals retreated. Days passed, and another swarm attacked. I lost consciousness and woke up in a dark cave. I found a rusty axe and looted the rest of a nearby table. I left to find the entrance of the cave until I finally reached it. I headed back towards my shelter and took the time to take a rest inside. I was woken up by another swarm of cannibals and I finally lost against them. A great game, awesome and intense. But I would love to see a peaceful mode or something, where you can play the game without as many cannibals if any at all. Myabe just a diffuculty setting that changes how long it stays dark, how many cannibals spawn and how much damage you take from each hit. I think this would improve the game for me and others, giving the chance for a better start until you get my grasp fully on the game."
