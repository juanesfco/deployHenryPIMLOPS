2013-12-27,50300,True,Spec Ops the line how can i describe it was one of those games which i thought would just be a normal third person shooter and to begin with it was just that the gameplay was very typical of everyother third person shooter however the story began to really get going and here is where spec ops the line really shines. It's one of those games where you'll wonder 'was that the right choice' and 'did i really have to do that'Overall Spec Ops the line is a game i recommend it to anyone for its story alone it was one of the greatest story driven games ive played in a long time9/10. only reason it does not get a 10 is the controls are a bit annoying some times
