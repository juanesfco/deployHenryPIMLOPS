2016-05-14,244930,True,YO so for stright i think theres a few things that need to be improved on so adding a anitmation for taking your skis over and being able to walk up large hills becuase trying to ski deep things is too hard you slide back etc having snow moble added in so you can use it to traval faster to diffrent loccations snow board so you could have this attached on your back and swap but key is to keep animation so you can go up a hill and then switch to snow board prefable being faster then the skis animations for basic pushing now this feels lacking haveing an exzact anitmation sking every time you push if would be awsome to have multileple more natural pushing like when u start off you move them left to right which is really coolstore needs to have a equip key the snow needs glimmer in the sun etc more realisem theres a few more thing but cool atm geting coins etc should be in the tornyments or events so bronze is 10 points silver 20  gold 30cheers hopes devs see  this would make game feel so much better
