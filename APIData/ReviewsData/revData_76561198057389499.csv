Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering 'should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead'. From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can't really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game)."

2016-05-04,318420,True,"The gameplays relatively the same as the main game but with more focus on branding uruks rather than killing them, but the main attraction is the One Ring which to be fair is OP againts warcheifs and makes them a breeze but i guess thats what the One Ring is, a ring of power. By far the best thing about the DLC is the final boss battle which isnt just QTE this time and   is really fun and takes around 20 minutes to beat (with about 1-2 deaths). The gameplay up to the end is a bit repetitive but the boss makes up for it."
2016-03-05,225540,True,"It's a great game if you get past the peformance issues, but personally I run it fine with an FX 8320 and a GTX 960 4gb at 1080 60hz (getting around 60-65 fps and 50 lowest) at very high settings with global illumination off (cause that drops you about 10-20 frames)Now for the proper review:It's great8.5/10 could've been a 9/10 if it weren't for a few bugs and glitches and peformance issues for some people.Also the bavarium rocket launcher = 2 gud 5 me"
