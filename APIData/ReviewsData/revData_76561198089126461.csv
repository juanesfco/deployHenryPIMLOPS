The Story is brilliant with great humour and references, I was laughing the whole way through. Christopher Lloyd was brilliant as Doc once again and A.J. Locascio was spot on as Marty, he sounded just like the real thing. Seeing Michael J. Fox pop up as Marty's Great Grandad Willie, made me so happy. I love this game!!!"
