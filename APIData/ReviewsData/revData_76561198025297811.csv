2014-04-21,249130,True,"Have you ever been playing Grand Theft Auto and thought: 'I wish this was in lego... and I could play as the Incredible Hulk.'Yeah good, because it's nothing like that. Good for a rainy day, and once you get through all the missions it IS fun just to run around the open world, but the latter half of the missions reaaaaally drag. Story isn't its strong point, but I don't believe it was ever intended to be. Probably helps to be familiar with the source material (I knew enough to laugh at the jokes the first time they were uttered...)Some cool bits: Guardians of the Galaxy/Ant Man are apparently unlockable! And another* Nick Fury/Pulp Fiction nod (post credits 'mission'). And Spider Man in open world is never a bad thing. Ever.Uh yeah. Fun to bash around as Spider Man, Captain America, Hulk for a bit. The other characters are a bit clunky. Get it if it's cheap?"
