2014-05-09,440,True,"When I first heard about this game, all my friends wanted me to play it. I put it off for quite a while... And then I realised it was free! So, I downloaded it, got on a server with one of my friends... 2 seconds later, I'm having the time of my life! Team Fortress 2 is and exiting fast-paced game that has many classes all with strengths and weaknesses... It's fun to both become a Heavy or Pyro and just oblitherate everything in your path, and to become a Medic or Spy to try to be tactful and sneaky... No matter what your into, Team Fortress 2 is perfect! I strongly recommend absolutly anyone to pick up this game, and play!"
