So many gamemodes to keep you playing the game. Then the amazing workshop and addons, I had to move garry's mod to my D drive due to downloading so many addons. The sandbox is amazingly fun to play and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes multiplayer games. Even without internet the sandbox is increadbly fun to play with. Get this game if you haven't."
