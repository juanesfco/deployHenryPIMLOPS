2016-06-02,368370,True,"[SPOILER FREE REVIEW]Ok, for a game included in a US$1 humble bundle, I got my monies worth. You get about 2 hours (3 hours to 100% achievements) of gameplay which is basically typing in keywords into a 90's styled PC.The 'gameplay' is to work out what to type in. Anything returning more than 5 results will only show 5 results and will only show the oldest files first, limiting what you can view and protecting the 'newest' files from being shown.Once I eventually found the answers I needed (and I got my 'ahh, clever devs...clever...' moment) I was satisfied, though if I spent anymore than US$1 on this I would have felt slightly cheated. It's a game that you could watch a youtube playthrough and possibly (depending on the youtuber) enjoy it more. I did enjoy the experience, though I'll be uninstalling it within seconds of posting this review as there is zero replay value (unless you want to grab the remaining achievements, which is basically ensuring that you watch every video).tl;dr - For US$1 it's worth it if you like VHS quality 'who dunnit' and indie games."
2016-04-15,244930,True,"Recommended for Windows. NOT recommended for Linux/SteamOS (as of 15/04/2016). Crashes, resolution issues, general unhappiness. Streaming from Windows to SteamOS is fine though.Pros:+ Doesn't appear to be pay-to-win (yet)+ Snowboarding and Snowmobile patches coming soon+ Fun to play, relaxing music (limited songs though)+ Leveling, steam achievements, steam cloud+ Keyboard and controller (xbox 360 tested) both work well, though controller preferredCons:- Ragdoll physics are funny to watch but are competely bonkers- No ragdoll in multiplayer (insta-tombstone)- Limited music- No local co-op/multiplayer on the same PC (this would be great feature imho)- Fear of a pay-to-win, pay-to-play model in the future. I'd love the devs to state something regarding this"

2015-12-30,342580,True,"For a game that is frequently for sale for a value less than the value of the cards that will drop, this is actually a fun time waster gamer.Recommended, though don't expect to have your RTS gathering or building skills put to the test, this is a game that a child, being instructed to click everything, can complete most levels.It's something to play while waiting to play other games.For the achievement junkies, 100% achievement in 6 ish hours."
2015-09-26,341310,True,"I wished there was a 'meh' inbetween rating rather than forcing us to choose Yes or No. This game is indeed 'meh'.Pros: Interesting storyline, 100% steam achievements in 2 hours ish, trading cards, can be purchased with a 90+% discount.Cons: Deep concept, delivered shallow. Extremely short. RPG Maker games are being pumped out pretty quick and they are starting to all feel same-same.I believe I purchaed this game at 96% off, no doubt seeing that the cards will mean that I'll make the money back on the game (don't you love how Steam does this every now and then?). Achievements is a plus as I do like hunting for extras within a game and sometimes this provides some replayability. Well, I played it, twice (to get all of the achievements) and noticed that I still had a single card drop left. This is a short game. At full price, I'd feel ripped off.The game concepts were good and I'd wish they could have extended it somehow or made it more branching (as compared to kill/not kill). It could also be a bit darker, at least it would have made you think about the choices you were making a bit more.tl;dr - If it's only a few cents and you're a card trader or achievement hunter, go for it. If you're after a great game then you'll be found wanting."
2015-07-20,250620,True,"An enjoyable game but not a great game. Is it worth US$20? No. Half that? Maybe. The game itself is a unique (when's the last time you played as a baby?) first person horror/puzzle game though the puzzles aren't difficult and the horror aspects aren't that scary (or more acurately, life theatening). While the game was enjoyable it's not going to be one of those horror games that you'll get your friends over to play, there are other horror games better suited to that. At only 3 hours it's over quite quickly with no replayability apart from ensuring that you grab all of the achievements. Speaking of which, the four achievements are easy to achieve so it's a good game for the completionists.NOTE TO STEAMOS PLAYERS: It claims full controller support though on Steam OS 2.0 Preview (@ 20/07/2015) using an XBOX 360 controller it was not playable due to controller issues (appears that the mappings were wrong, cannot change settings in game so stuck with non-performing controller).TL;DR - Grab it when it's greater than 50% off as there is an enjoyable game here, though it'll last only 3 hours as there's no replayability."
2015-07-19,221910,True,"Recommended if you grab it cheap, very enjoyable 3 hour experience. First person playstyle, narrator driven gameplay with multiple story arcs where replayability is actually a core part of the game mechanics. At $15 USD it's an expensive game for the 3 hours ish enjoyment out of it (and hitting 5 of 10 achievements) - if you can grab it at 50% off or better I'd say do it."
2014-12-15,48700,True,"Well worth it if you find it on special. It's a game that can easily turn into a time sink (in a good way).Slow to start though draws you in as you build your own personal army. You do get the feeling that 'just a bit more and I'll be unstoppable' only to find out that the game has a way of forcing the game back into a nice balance. NPCs you'll love to hate.tl;dr - enjoyable game, lots of community mods."
2016-06-10,320140,True,"Short (less than three hours to 100% achievement) though very enjoyable game with an XBOX360 controller. The 'end game' is attempting higher scores on specific tracks while the 'main game' is progress through 6 worlds, with the 6th being no more than a play to wrap the game up and roll credits.Don't buy this game if you're expecting realistic physics or even blow-off valve accuracy - you contantly paint black tyre marks which gives a nice artistic feel to your movements, though I would have much preferred a way to only show tyre marks only when actually skidding. This isn't a drifting simulator. This isn't a racing game. This is a chilled out explorer and you play the role of an AE86.I hope they make Absolute Drift 2 and give more substance. An ability to modify the car that would have an effect on the physics would be cool as well as camera angles. Obviously multiplayer for some door-on-door drifing action would be great and anything to make this a game that you'd want to go back to once you unlocked everything that needed to be unlocked.Is it worth US$11.99? For a three-hour ish game? That's only a maybe. It had been on my wish list for a long time and it blew me away seeing it on HumbleBundle so keep an eye out - this game is definately worth it if you can get it discounted."
2016-06-05,408120,False,"Wow. WTF did I just play. In short, don't bother.[MILD SPOILERS]There is no game here as there's no actual choices being made. You 'play' as Nina, who has never had a boyfriend and never had sex who falls for someone on an MMORPG who has also never had a girlfriend and never had sex. You basically listen to them VOIP and watch a few short movies. The game is over within an hour. There was no way to change any outcomes and the 'game' that you're forced to play was a grind (and not in an ironic MMORPG way). I would have TK'ed him if the server rules allowed it.Super indie, super boring, super quick and for US$8.99 full price (though I snagged it for US$1 in the humble bundle) it is way overpriced.I could be harsher though I'm holding myself back here."
