2013-12-20,72850,True,I haven't got many hours on PC yet but on 360 I have 300+ hours and I absolutely love it! I'd say its possibly the best game I have ever played and in general possibly the best game ever made! Try to pick up the legendary edition as its the same price and especially go for it if its on sale! I got it for about $17.00!
