There is only three tracks, two cars, no results at the end of the race (only an option to retry or go back to the garage) which is pretty damn minimilistic and It has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ framerate like you're playing on an Xbox One. I also didn't like how your car just resets in the destruction derby if you roll over! That has to go! You should have to stay like that until someone rolls you back over or you get obliterated! I know that it will most likley include it so I should'nt really have to say it but multiplayer is a MUST!Looking forward to experiencing it evolving as I know it is going to be awesome eventually!"
