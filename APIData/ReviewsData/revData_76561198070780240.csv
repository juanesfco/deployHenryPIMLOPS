I have been playing Magic (the actual card game) for 16 years, so I am not new to the strategy involved in it. But when you go against a low ranked player and have them down to 6 health and then suddenly they have 5 Plainswalkers and Ulamog in quick succession, the play to win element becomes very apparent. If you want to rank anywhere on this game, pour money into it. If you want single player, it is a bit of limited fun. Otherwise, stay away."
