The protagonist is just a guy who feels sorry for himself and thinks too much, heaps of inner dialogue that jump from one topic to the next not really serving any purpose besides telling the reader what we already know from a paragraph or so in; he feels sorry for himself. Instead of assuming we know that by now, this concept gets dragged on for such a long time making -me- feel sorry for myself as he goes on and on about his boring lifestory. I think what makes it really hard for me to continue playing is my lack of interest in the protagonist as a character I will have to put up with the whole visual novel through. While I understand his sentiments and probably the purpose of him being so lifeless before he gets to the actual camp and 'lives it up' or something like that, I still don't get it and I don't agree with the execution. Another thing that bothered me was the blurr effects in the beginning when he looks around his room. I don't quite understand the purpose of that and it just annoyed me. Is he still sleepy or something? Why can't he talk about that instead of how ordinary and uninteresting his life is? At least that would serve an actual purpose.Like I said, I haven't played much and I wanted to give it a chance but it is what it is. It may be considered as a 'visual novel loved by many' in the description but I'm sorry, count me out. It just isn't for me.Soviet Games, I hope you continue making more visual novels to come with your beautiful assets and put more thought into the writing delivery/ cut out the unnecessary bits because the length of a story doesn't equal quality.
