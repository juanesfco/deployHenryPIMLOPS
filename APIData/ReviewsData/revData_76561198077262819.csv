2016-05-14,730,True," Great time consuming game, a game you can totally immerse yourself in , with only the  Slight catch of a light wallet. I absolutely love this game, it provides a great challenge, while making it fun and enjoyable. This is one of the few games that requires the player to have a strong tactile intuition, and good communication with your comrades, that is absolutely essential for an enjoyable game. At first you laugh at people spending money on this game, next minute you're drawing blood from a stone, and bam, all your cash is gone. That is the only catch. Lightwallet/10 would pay again. Anyhow, defiantly check this bugger out, bloody worth it."
