2014-12-27,213670,True,ERIC CARTMAN IS BACK WITH A HILARIOUS GAME 8.3/10  The gameplay and storyline was amazing just like the tv show but the fighting was not very good. Sometimes it would take people 5 minutes to take down a bossi wish the developers reconsider on how to improve their next title :D
