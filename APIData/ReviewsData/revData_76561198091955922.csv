His character and skills are on FULL display here. -Take on your dangerous missions in many ways - never touch an enemy OR bring your assault shotgun attachement and party-Tactical whistling - simple and futurisic tools are at your disposal -Very robust mechanics, reliable and challenging AI (that scales well with difficulty levels) -Good graphics that even works at excelent frame rate on my 2003 Dell lapop/fax machine-No DRM -Recommendation: Easy mode: Quick save whenever you want. Fun mode: Whole mission without saves (unbind quicksave controls and iron man mode it!)-Graphics are not 2015 Triple-A level, do some research to decide-Hard to follow storyBe the ghost's shadow that saves the world"
2015-10-23,275200,True,"Great story and gameplay. Worth the price, I feel like a bandit for buying it on sale, it is worth diamonds.-Rememberable, funny, action packed, challenging and most of all FUN.-Story is single player - Randomly generated elements when starting a new game. Local co-op available too.-Motivation drives you forward whilst the characters and world itself makes each step worth it.-Nice touch that you can customize your looks and arms (by arms I mean guns - though *guns* aren't your only choice). -Framerate drop occasionally HOWEVER consider I played on my 2003 Dell laptop - slowdown allowed me to enjoy the music better.-Needs controllers for Local co-op, controllers connected to PC works.-Can have up to 3 different games going on at once.Buy it. Play it. Revenge awaits in the west."
