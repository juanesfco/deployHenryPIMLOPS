Could barely see a thing and before I had a chance to light my storm lantern, I heard a familiar chilling growl, followed by abrupt barking.Instead of making the clever decision of turning around, re-entering the Gas Station and waiting it out til dawn, I began to run blindly through the pitch black whilst the wolves took up pursuit.I stumbled across a car and now I'm stuck in it, surrounded by a pack of three terrifying black shapes who are on constant patrol.  They keep walking by the windows.  They know I'm here.And I'm slowly freezing to death.I love this damn game."

Then bought it for my own account because it's an abolutely amazing enjoyable addictive timesink with a simple but effective story and weirdly fun gameplay.  Proved to me I should give a game a chance first, not take it at face value."
