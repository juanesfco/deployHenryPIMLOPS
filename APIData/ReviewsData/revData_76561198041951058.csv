2015-09-25,333930,True,Dirty bomb is such a chilled out fps compared to others i play which makes it something of a stress relief.Good game to play if your not looking for something highly competitive.The gameplay in Dirty Bomb is very fast paced and exciting.Lots of classes with different weapons and abilities.
2015-09-25,304030,True,Got to max level in under 3 weeks and then got annoyed at the ping in pvp. If PVE is all your interested in then this is fine for you but players with lower ping do get an advantage in all combat because there is no queing for spells.The world is beautiful with lots of different places to explore. The trading system is really good and the House/Boat building is excellent if you can find a block of land.
