2013-01-06,440,True,"Tf2 is a great game although its more of a hat wearing contest then a shooter..It has a very good frame rate so normally there is no lag..Very addictive..Hackers play the crap out of this game so you will probably find a few hackers..Lots of different weopans and there are hats worth THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.Over all it is a great game also its free so if you havent already go check out Tf2, although you will probs spend real money on keys and what not, and i probably missed a few things whilst doing my short review. 8.5/10"
