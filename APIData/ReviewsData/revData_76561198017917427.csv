2014-11-04,224260,True,"This goes to all ♥♥♥♥ wits that dont like this game cause its realistic for one its easy to get infected yes what the ♥♥♥♥ do you think would happen if a zombie bit you second a melee is slow cause it has to be you go out and swing a sledge hammer and i can garentee the guy in game is stronger then you,yes its slow paised but if you were in a zombie apocalypse do you think youll be running around shooting everything in sight (if you would your a ♥♥♥♥ wit and wouldn't last five minutes) ok i guess what im getting at is the people that vote up the game and the guys in game have balls"
