2013-07-14,4000,True,"This game is amazing! It's like Minecraft mixed with Team Fortress 2. Not only is this game a lot of fun but when you buy certain games maps and weapons from that game come into this one. This game has no story but it doesnt need one, its just a fun sandbox that will provide entertaining gameplay for a long time to come. Worth my money for sure, everyone shuld get this game."
