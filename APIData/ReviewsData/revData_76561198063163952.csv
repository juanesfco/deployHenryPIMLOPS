2016-06-18,383980,True,"Recommended for people that have experience with Melee or Project M [SSB In General] I had to get this game after watching Mango's Stream, I finally got it and I was suprised how fun it is. I play on a Logitech Game Pad I got a few years ago [For Castle Crashers] (Being Honest here) The ControlsFelt Wonky at the begining because my jump was my [Y] Button and Weak Attack was my [A] ButtonI finally got used to after a couple of games and got into finding alot of combos. The Parry idea doesnt fit for meas a SSB player and I never use it (REMEMBER THERES NO SHIELDS NOR GRABS). I hope the Devs decide to add morecharacters to the mix.My rating - 80/100"
