The story is phenomenal and really makes the case for it's accolades, Yahtzee was right, it's one for the history books and it's a game I will remember for a long time. You feel guilty and bad for the things you do, you get involved emotionally and it's the most realistic portrayal of the horrors of war. This game is excellent."
