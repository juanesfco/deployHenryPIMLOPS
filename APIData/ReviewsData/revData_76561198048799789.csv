2015-05-05,32400,True,"Downloaded this with no idea what to expect after getting it in a humble bundle. It is honestly one of my favourite games and probably my favourite star wars game. Occasionally you get lost and a walk through can be handy just to find where you have to go to next but other than that it it great. It is fast paced, the shooting is actually pretty good, the movement feels solid and I expect to finish then game some time soon.Definitely recommend."
