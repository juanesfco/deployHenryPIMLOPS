But unfortanly I'm probally not going to recommend this game, reason being the game deleted my save file after 18 hours of gameplay, What a real disappointment. There was a fix around, but really come on hello games, what title out today has trouble saving your progress, and because of that I probally wont get back it to it. I had the momentum going for this game, but once it ♥♥♥♥♥ in your face you cant go back."
