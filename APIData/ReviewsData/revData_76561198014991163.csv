It's got great strategic customisation and each game could have a ton of variations. At its best you have deep tactics, sweat-inducing shooting and surprising turnovers, but I'll admit there are a few games where teams just get steamrolled.Matchmaking seems to be improving. Balance is pretty good relatively speaking."
2016-06-01,333930,True,"As far as F2P shooters go, Dirty Bomb is possibly among the best out there. Highly recommended for people who want a good shooter to play for free.The features that set this above and apart all others are:- Very fair pricing: With minimal play time, it's possible to get a 50,000 credit hero permanently unlocked in 1-2 weeks. If you play each game mode every day and win once, you get 2,000 credits everyday and you can get 1,500-3,000 if you complete the objectives that cycle every 3 hours. No change in power above bronze cards.- High skill requirements: There's very little auto-aim (1 turret class) and a lot of hip-firing skill is required. Against snipers, small HP mercs move fast and there's ample flanking paths. Tank classes are usually balanced by slow movement or needing medics and fire support characters to feed them. - Massive focus on teamplay: Success is highly dependent on your team having a medic, fire support, engineer, assault and recon. At high levels you're going to need serious co-ordination between your team.- You can still carry: Despite the requirement for team-play, a good player is easily recognised in Dirty Bomb. You may not win but you'll make the other team pay hard. With enough skill, a medic could keep the entire team healed and push the opposition back.- Varied heroes: All mercs are functionally distinct and highly balanced. Each merc has specific loadouts and skills that contribute to the game.- Server browser: Wish other games had this. Negatives are:- Matchmaking: Sometimes you're going to up against stacked teams.- Loadout system: You have a fixed loadout that others may not like as it forces them into a specific weapon / augment they may not like. Fortunately, bronzes are relatively cheap. - RNG: You can select the hero that you want to get a loadout, but the cheapest path requires RNG. Special events also have a lot of RNG involved. However, you can buy a bronze loadout you want with in-game credits for 17,500 credits. - Minor glitches: I've had a little rubber banding here and there. High ping players seem to teleport around every now and then. Nothing major. - Hackers: Relative to other F2P shooters, though, Dirty Bomb has a very low hacker problem. That said, it's not like there's no cheaters ever."
2016-06-30,301910,True,I had forgotten how much I loved flying around in SRIV. This was short enough to remind me how much I enjoyed that game but not long enough to wear on me. Good if you can get it on discount and want to blast a weekend away.
2014-06-20,241540,True,"There's a few clipping glitches, but generally the game runs smooth. The first few hours are quite tense as you start your community and explore the world. Deaths come really easy, but as you play on you get a strong sense of progression for your character. Even though you won't like them at first, you'll craft your own stories of their heroic deeds and when that bloody juggernaught ripped the God-Warrior Marcus in half just as he was about to save the entire community.... it hurt."
