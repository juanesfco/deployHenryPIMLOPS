2015-09-01,291550,True,"Good game, however anyone I assume 'far' from the servers ( I am Oceanic) will have ping issues, and the game is especially about timing so it's incredibly frustrating getting pummeled because your actions do not register."

2015-05-25,304500,False,"Nice gimmick, but boring and repetitive after  2 minutes."
2016-08-20,282070,False,"It's average. Incredibly overhyped. Still riddled with a miriad of bugs, crashes and inconsistencies."
2016-08-14,252490,False,Will never come out of Early Access. Runs like ♥♥♥♥. Boring as ♥♥♥♥.
2015-10-15,339280,False,"Rarely updated, abandoned by dev's. Stay away."
2015-11-17,227940,False,"The movement in this game is completely and utterly broken, and always will be. Blatant pay to win / pay to level. Go play warthunder or an alternative. This game is truly bad."
2016-08-20,242050,False,The controls for this game are absolute ♥♥♥♥ing trash. Want to jump off a building whilst trying to climb? yea. Want to repeatedly die because 'let go of the wheel' is the same keyboard bind as 'slow down' ? Yea. Want to repeatedly pull out weapons and shoot the objective accidentally? yea. great game bar the ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious control ports.
