2014-05-28,6910,True,Amazing depth and complexity that you just don't see today. So much content available if you take the time to look.
2015-09-13,291250,True,"Bit of a mixed bag, really.The atmosphere and feel of the game are great. If you felt that Pioneer was a bit too realistic, this is the game for you. Unfortunately, the game is plagued with bugs and updates have been infrequent (though I may be proven wrong in the near future) I have personally been enjoying it, though."
