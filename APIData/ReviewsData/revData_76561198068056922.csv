Once you pass those few levels, you'll hit the biggest pay wall I've ever experience. Everyone you verse will have payed weapons you just can't compete with, and amazing gear that makes your really bad weapons, ever worse.In the terms of match making, the queue times are pretty short, a minute or so to get in game. You'll be lucky to get into the medium connection speeds if you're not in the US, and the majority of the community doesn't speak english anyway, which is terrible for such a tactical shooter.Try it if you want, but you'll suffer under the might that is Pay to Win."
