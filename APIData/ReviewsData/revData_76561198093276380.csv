2015-07-04,10500,True,"This game is quite good in combat, in some good areas of campaign and maybe a little bit of multiplayer. However I'm dissapointed in the acheivements. I play many nations in the grand campaign on easy and normal to earn the the level acheivements, however I still didn't get it. I even conqured india to earn that conquest of india acheivement and I still didn't get it. This game has screwed me over the acheivements, however if u play all the nations and still have fun with the multiplayer ur going to love it."
