2016-07-05,251570,False,"DISCLAIMER - This is written from a perspective of someone who played this game back in 2015I know that this is early access and I'm probably writing about an earlier version of the game. From my experience, it didn't forfill how I thought this game was going to be from the trailers and such. At the time of playing it, this game was riddled with bugs, its performance was absolute crap and I just didn't find myself giving the patience needed to really get into this game because I honestly didn't know where to start, and my friend wasn't very happy either with what I convinced him to buy with me.Now I know alot of people will disagree, maybe I'm just getting boring as a person, I'm not sure.But my experience with this game just honestly didn't captivate me in time before I grew very bored of it."
2016-01-05,41000,True,Used to mock this game with my friend about the title...Nice friend bought it for me to play with him...I find out its actually decent..This game is quite a laid back fps shooter that is great mindless fun with your friends and is a great steal off the steam sale.Try not to let the title decieve you because it may suprise you.7/10
2015-12-24,620,True,"Portal 2 is the second and latest installment in the portal series, in the portal series you solve puzzles.. with portals! I would like to start off by stating that I absolutely love this game in every way imaginable. If you don't want to read the rest of this review then all I can say is just purchase it because this a game that I would love to forget about and start over with.Storyline:The storyline in this is just amazing and is one of the things that keeps you going and playing through this game, no matter how hard the puzzles are, and just when you think you have had enough it just hooks you back in again for more.Gameplay:The majority of Portal 2's gameplay consists of puzzle solving right from the start. At the start puzzle solving is relatively easy and quite simple, but once you start getting into it, it slowly gets more difficult as you progress through the test chambers, and they always keep it interesting when adding new elements to the tests every now and again. One thing is for sure though, you will find yourself getting stuck and maybe even a bit frustrated but a small break to re-gather your thoughts is all it takes to figre out a puzzle.Atmostphere:One thing that this game is best at is making you feel lonely. The emptiness of the ambience and soundtrack is really all it takes to make you feel alone, and this is probably one of the best features it has. The soundtracks that were picked for this game are just incredible at creating an amazing atmostphere.Coop:Coop is just a load of fun with your friends, it really is just fun to mess around with them, block their portals and just do whatever the hell you want. That's not saying that you can't be serious as well.Overall:I really do think that Valve thought this game out well, and created an amazing experience. Especially with all this content included it really is such a bargain to grab off a steam sale.11/10 Amazing"

2015-12-22,8190,True,"This game is the definition of fun. Basically you blow up everything in sight and terrorize the government and people of Panau in an absolutely massive world thats around 1,000 square kilometers big. I know I have little hours in this game but multiplayer mode has been the main reason I bought this game and it is twice the fun of the base game as you can do all of the above but with friends!8.5/10 Best I don't give a F*ck simulator of all time."
2015-12-22,17410,True,I fell in love with this game the first time I even saw it and I thought to myself 'I have to get this game' and about a year later the wait was still well worth the amazing experience I had with this game. You could almost call this game badass simulator 2015 because free running and kicking enimies in the face is probably the most rewarding thing you will do in this game. The only things that this game lacks are the openess and length of the game.10/10
2015-11-25,286690,True,"A great and imersive game with a huge amount detail. Even if its quite linear, the atmostphere is just amazing and when your alone, you really feel alone. Story is great, gameplay is difficult but fun, and overall a great game."
2015-02-06,220240,True,Far cry 3 is by far the best shooter I've ever played. This game has everything I've ever wanted in a game from open world gameplay to fantastic combat mechanics with stunning graphics especially for 2012. Even without the story (which is exeptional) there is still so much to do like climb radio towers and activate them to reveal more of the map or take over outposts etc.10/10 what an incredible game
