2015-03-31,202970,True,The game is really cool graphics but i don't play the campain i only play online but i need to change my graphics card because i get around 30 40 to 45 fps which is good.
2014-11-27,440,True,It has 10 times more guns than the counter strike series but still i give it 8.9/10 rubber scouts. xD
2014-05-28,730,True,Well i play this game on maxed out graphics with filter to 4x and texturing also on 4 i play it at the highest resolution my monitor does (1280x1024) and  in mostly all the time i get 60-75-80 fps and in bad times it dropped down to 50-40 or 20. Morral of the review: put in a better graphics card for better performance xD                                                    but i am giving it 9.7/10
