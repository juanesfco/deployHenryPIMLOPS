2012-09-09,209870,True,"One of the most epic free to play, first person shooter game I have ever played.NOTE: Whoever is reading this review now (which I doubt personally), and doesn't agree with this review I made. Please note that this review is made before the release of the PS4 version which casue the PC version to be out of date now. I haven't play the game for a long time but what I have read from other reviews has kept me up to date with what has happen to the game now and it's sad to hear that Blacklight is no longer being focus by the developers anymore because of the PS4 version."
