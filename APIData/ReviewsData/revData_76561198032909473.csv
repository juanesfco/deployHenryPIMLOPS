The introduction of microtransactions brought, among many other things, the downfall of a great game. The community has devolved, promises were broken. Shame on your Overkill. Shame. On. You."
2014-12-21,274940,True,"For someone who's scared of sharks, I'm hooked on this game. 9/10, could do with a few tweaks, but so far I'm happy with the shredding of human flesh.Edit: Changing this to a 0/10 because this game ruined my life. Obviously my unstable social life disintegrated and my sleep disappeared but I'm ok with that.Matchmaking as of 26/12/2014 needs some work. There are minimum 5 minute waits to play as a shark but couple seconds for diver. It'd be great to even those out. I'd love to see a next match button, more sharks and more maps in the future. As well as match editing if possible."

2015-08-11,346110,True,"I've never played a game where they took the effort to add in the poo system. Some things require some serious dedication, mainly the taming side of things. But I'll be damned if I won't find the time to tame a Carnotaur so I can have it play fight with a trike."
2015-03-05,270850,True,"I now know that if I ever become a mechanic, I will most likely beat people to death with a socket wrench for the way they treat their cars. It's like IT but more time consuming and more expensive. Other than that great game that contains the very basics of car maintenance, however before trying anything like this at home, seek proper guidance. Look forward to the next installment."
2015-01-07,213670,True,This game was made to offend. That is all.
