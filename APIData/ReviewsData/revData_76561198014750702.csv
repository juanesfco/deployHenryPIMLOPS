2013-04-12,8870,True,"Playing on hard and stopping to smell the flowers (Reading things on walls, looking around, etc.) I clocked 13.2 hrs for my first playthrough. This game cost $80 WITHOUT dlc currently and I think it is a bit crazy considering there is no multiplayer or survival, anything like that.But that being said the story, immersion, graphics and first person shooter elements are all blended in perfectly together and make for a wonderful experience, although again I'm not sure the price is quite justified.For the game itself and not it's value for money I think the 96/100 metascore rating is well deserved and an immersive leap into the floating city of Columbia!"
