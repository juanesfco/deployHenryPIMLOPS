2015-12-07,225540,True,Just Cause 3 was my most hyped game of the year ( I've never like fallout for some reason) and to be honest it lived up to my expectations. I feel bad for the people having issues with this game as my mediocre system runs Jc3 with the occasional frame drop/stutter. I believe this game is a worthy successor to Jc2 and my definate GOTY
