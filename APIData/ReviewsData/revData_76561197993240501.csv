2013-06-20,43160,True,"Deffinetly worth buying this game ! You will never play a better story driven, stealthy, rpg (sorta), fps or survival singleplayer game again !! Currently on my second play through and the games just gotten better, DLC out soon for it to (and is pretty cheap) so even more replayability value :D Would recommend playing Metro:2033 first though since the story for Last Light continues where u left off in 2033 with little explanation or knowledge of what you had done in the first one. Metro 2033 is a great game aswell so dont be having doubts about it since its the first one !"
2013-03-08,230940,True,hahaha wtf when i thought some game dlc  that costs $$ couldnt get any stupider this game comes out with new warcrys to yell as dlc for $5 
2013-03-06,202970,True,"Yer good fun but its just another CoD. Only thing thats got long playability to this game is the Zombies Mode, but thats just me so if you like multiplayer and want a sortve Halo/Crysis style about it, but the gameplay of CoD then its probably gona be worth buying. Campaigns pretty good and has some mad gee up n intense moments in it and crazy twists in the story, and even alternate endings for the way youve played it, but like i said before its just another CoD and you'll probably only be buying it for multiplayer anyways."
