2014-11-14,209650,True,At first this game was really laggy for me but since the patch ive seen massive improvement in this game. But im still having trouble loading two maps Instinct and defender. Sometimes i will get into defender and it will be laggy to the point it makes me look like im cheating and im not. but all that aside i really enjoy this game so if your a cod fan i suggest to get this game.
