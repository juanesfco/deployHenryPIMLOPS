2016-06-19,238960,True,A diablo like with a unique twist to skills and an awesome skill tree.
2015-03-07,319250,True,"The description they give you is perfect. At first it's just basic add fire damage, electricity makes it jump...Then in a matter of maybe 20 minutes you start to find all the good crazy stuff! Shoot an arcing magic bolt that on impact summons monsters! Shoot three different lazer beams that travel through ground to shoot those enemies through the wall! The effects are simple, constant and easy (usually) to control but give all sorts of crazy, awesome, abilities. Love it."
2016-03-19,262060,True,"This is still a work in progress while I slowly cover topics as I come by. If you need anything make a post on the forums and I'll probably be there.The upperpart of my review is of the game below that I will address the points of some of the negative reviews.Darkest Dungeon is fairly straightforward, multiple heroes with varying skills and abilities that you send off to a dark lovecraftian dungeon to fend off creatures battling to keep your health, hunger and sanity in check. In a sense it plays a little like an old Final Fantasy game, but without any pheonix downs and every monster matters.There are four seperate dungeons (and then the end game dungeon) that each have their own unique strengths and weaknesses and thus who you send into each area is often unique. As you select your four heroes you need to make some tough decisions. Will you send the Plague doctor? The only hero to boast both a double stun and double poison skill. The Bounty Hunter who can uppercut your enemies into different ranks? Or a mighty Man at Arms who can guard another while boosting his own defense and then next round can activate a counter attack! Rather than just a simple 'Me am warrior me am stronk!' teams who can work together and take out the nasty healers and stress dealers, who hide in the back rank, fast and first will leave the dungeon sane while the slow teams with very little reach into the back rows will teem with madness and disease.Darkest Dungeon features a fairly linear weapon and armor system (coupled with some reasonable D&D type factors in how speed and other mechanics work) but offers a unique trinket system that can spice up combat. A disease and quirk system, diseases are obviously bad while quirks come in good and bad qualities.The final piece is the stress system, while dungeoneering your Heroes will gain stress through various means, will they crack under pressure? Or will they stand steady as a beacon of hope?In its entirety the game offers a well known system but adds several unique mechanics to really make it stand out.I would highly recommend anyone interested in this game but still unsure to watch some playthroughs on youtube.Also, check out some of the reviews with large comment chains and you'll see downvoters calling upvoters 'shills'. They're absolutely paranoid that people can like this game. It's pretty funny.For a while I thought this game was too hard, that I was doing everything right and that RNG was screwing me over.Then I got gud and realized that I had everything wrong. It is tough and RNG will kick you while you're down but many of these downvotes are blatant lies and I would like to address them here.'You lose 10-20 hours per character that dies' I have lost about 4 max rank characters, and a few rank 3-4 ones aswell, at time of posting this I have 88 hours gameplay. My roster is almost full of max rank characters and I beat the game. The roster has 28 slots (+12 due to end game reasons), by his/her maths I'd need about 400-800 hours to do that.'I was 1-hit by a non crit' utter lies. Maybe, just maybe, they had a plague doctor in the front row with double -HP trinkets... but why have some one who is essentially protected by a tissue and as weak as a kitten in that situation and then act like it's not your fault when a GIANT hits you?Many, many of the complaints are 'I don't have a good team set up and I can't hit some one at the back!' Well that's probably their fault for bringing three units who can only hit the front two ranks and a healer.Several complaints are that the characters aren't equally powered and some outshine others, but I 100% believe the characters are extremely well balaned - it's all about using the characters correctly. For example the Plague Doctor isn't supposed to deal damage like a crusader/leper or heal HP like a Vestal, but a support class that can stun and poison (even two people at once) and stop heavy bleed/poison damage. Many - if not most - the complaints come from an update that causes stops enemies at the back from instantly moving forward when you kill a front unit. So rather than an open varied team they get upset their insanely powerful double leper set up (that guy 100% strongest solo character) can't just one hit everything.I have felt their pain but I can gaurantee that many of the complaints are biased and just frustrated that they couldn't get it right - even the forums get 'I attacked Wilbur and my characters said 'No don't do that you're upsetting the big one' and then the big one got angry WTF RNG I AM LEET PRO' (youtube darkest dungeons wilbur fails).I am not saying that their reviews are without merit, but the devolopers have made leaps and bounds to meet in the middle.Now you can hire higher leveled heroes, bonus XP under certain conditions and some units bring resources for dungeons and even a new class that adds some risk V reward.And if all else fails, ask for help on the forums. I sure have, the people there are (mostly) friendly and are willing to help.I have yet to find a bug or skill working improperly.If you find flaw within my review (and my review of negative reviews) please feel free to criticize or offer advice."
2015-12-07,299480,False,"I think the fact that most of the positive comments come from people with less than 10 hours, some less than four hours, show that this game just isn't really worth it.As for everyone downvoting this, check out all those below one hour gameplay good reviews, there's like three over 10 hours. It's so bad that even the good reviews are terrible."
2016-01-08,264140,False,"The game is enjoyable enough but suffers a lot of minor issues that snowball into a headache.I have a fairly large crew, trying to take down the end type of pirates and it's just a constant 'YAR!' 'SHIVER ME TIMBERS' every time I want to do something. I think you can turn it off, but it's still a head ache and then just becomes earily quiet as you listen to the great advance of... nothing.The AI is painful.Being shot at by cannons? Your crew will visit the roof. Raining that causes morale to drop? Roof visits for everybody! I just wish I could tell them to sit down a little easier.Or the guy with a fishing rod must stand on the right most corner block at the highest height possible, on the side you get attacked on. Why can't I tell him to stand on the good, safe, side?And all that fish... useless, everyone just dies of scurvy and refuses to eat the fruit you have so you just go out for excess fruit and never bother fishing.There are some things that people can use to increase stats/XP gain but they kept leaving to go do other things, I just want them to stay where I told them.I had 15 chickens constantly leaving fecal matter, I had their cages and I kept them until they leveled enough to lay eggs. I still have the two eggs that they laid (and I had them for several hours). After those two they refused to do anything.As far as teaching them skills, you almost always need cleaning because there is so much filth everywhere, swimming because insta-death sucks and before you know it almost everyone is practically a clone with skills that aren't so much choices but needs.I even spent 15 minutes not knowing why a ship of mine wasn't considered sea worthy just because I had a piece of backdrop in a place that they couldn't reach. The backdrop doesn't actually do anything besides look pretty, imagine your pirate ship not being allowed out because of a colour you chose. And the 'problem indicator' just showed the highest right-most block rather than showing me the problem.The weapons are either great or useless with little in-between. Through use or stones you can level them, either level 10, 25 or 50. But for so, so many weapons it's a useless waste of time or if it is useful a grind. Many have effects that aren't really useful because the weapon sucks. Weapons from stores also seem to display incorrect info? (Stores also sometimes don't display the in depth item info such as damage/DPS/stats/etc on certain items).The fights are just your guys rushing them, healing is a bit of a pain.And to travel from one place to the other you have to wait for your characters to get there, you can increase their speed with items but it is so tedious especially the first hour or so since you can't go too far from town or else risk running out of provisions.All in all the start to mid game was nice with none of these problems being that bad but as the game went on it stopped being fun to play."
2014-12-18,227680,False,"It had potential but fails to deliver. Long review short, I hate it."
2014-06-29,105600,True,This game is just awesome. A classic type of game that will have players staying for months and years. A delightfully simple system that just keeps you coming back for more!
2014-06-28,230410,True,"A good game, lovely graphics, enjoyable classes and flexibility with skills and customization, only down sides are excess of grinding (but a huge amount of fun fighting enemies with various weapons) for items, and no high tier content. All in all, you don't have to spend money and the first 50 hours just fly by without a second thought."
