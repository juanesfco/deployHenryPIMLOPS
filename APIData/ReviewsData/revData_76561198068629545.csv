2016-08-31,730,True,"CS:GO is filled with toxic people like the smart ♥♥♥,people who think that k/d ratio matter,people who look down on others,mic cutters etc.You get the point don't you?But on the other hand the gameplay is amazing and i would give it a 9.9 for its great gameplay but it did'nt get a 10 because of the toxic players.One of my friends went as far as to name his tec 9 toxic 'CS:GO Community' lol.I hope this review was helpful"
