2015-06-04,251170,False,"This game claims to be a lot more than it actaully is, Their is no offline training training, online is very laggy and it is only fun for about 30 minutes, the only reason I have more game time than that is that im forced 2 play it with my little brother. Another thing is that their are tons of maps but no difference in how they play"
