2014-04-09,8930,True,"Kinda steep learning curve, but as soon as you grasp the basics you will lose yourself in this game, it has so many things going for it, from the nice clean layout to the different victories, Civilisation V will keep you interested for a long, long time. You also learn heaps of interesting facts about History, which is always good "
