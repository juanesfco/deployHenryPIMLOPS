2014-05-25,211420,False,"hands down the most broken port i've ever played. the reason steam strongly recomends a controler is because none of the icons have been changed for pc and the keyboard layout is terriable. i had to download a mod to get it to play at the right resoloution and it doesn't screen tear to ♥♥♥♥. also on windows 8 it still runs of games for windows, i need another mod to fix that. almost nothing has been optimised for pc. wish i'd spent the  extra cash and got dark souls 2 instead"
