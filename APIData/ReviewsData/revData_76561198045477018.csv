2015-10-02,315880,False,I like the idea and I hope they help the gaming community to improve but as of right now I can't quit it so i can't play other games. I also can't uninstall it and it doesn't show up on my task manager. I restarted my computer but it is still running. Please make this work. Australia's horrible internet needs it.
