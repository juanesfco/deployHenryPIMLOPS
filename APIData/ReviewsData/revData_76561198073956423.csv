2014-04-14,730,True,This game is just plain addictive. It lives up to every expectation it promises you and even more. Within two days i had already racked up 11 hours.Pros-Great strategy.Teamwork really is needed.Realistic sounds.Makes you feel like you really are part of a firefight.Cons-Valve seems to be trying to scam money out of you all the time. Luckily its only for cosmetics.
