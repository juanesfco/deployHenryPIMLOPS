2016-07-05,472680,True,"Fantastic game and the story looks promising, I really enjoyed the first parts of the game. Art is nice and the music really fits the scenery. The only problem I have with the game at the current moment is that the where the text is shown to tell us what the characters is saying is a bit big and one of the pictures shows what I believe is a Ball-Point Pen during the time when the Prine and the Merchant are having a chat after they go downstairs in the Inn. Judging from the current art, this would seem something of medieval time. Apart from that I am looking foward to everything you have to throw at me. =^.^="
