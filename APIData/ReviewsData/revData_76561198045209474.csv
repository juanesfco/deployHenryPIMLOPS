2014-02-15,570,True,A complex game that gets more stratigic the higher level games you get into
2015-01-26,7670,True,"This game is just amazing. Bioshock is a big game filled with dark creepy corners, secrets and lore. Set in an old falling apart underwater city known as rapture the game quickly becomes an intresting shooter with enemies showing up out of knowhere to often scare you a little or at the least shock you (pun partially intended). The game is a good length with loads of things to find such as lore and added powers or bonuses for those who look. Overall this game is a great play and one of the classic games that everyone should play."
2014-12-29,94590,True,This game and the first are both short and amazing games. Though they are not worth the large base price they are amazing games to get once on sale. For just a few dollars you can have games set in a bizar town with bizaar charaters. This game and the first and a must for any fan of a good point and click or pizzle game.
