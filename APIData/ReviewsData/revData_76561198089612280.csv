2016-06-24,271590,False,Saddly one of the worst games i have played and me being me i have also played Roblox and what dose that tell you? anyway this game is very slow at the start reaches a medium and just DROPS after you complete everything and then what? hackers everywhere you go on 1 server hacker here another there they are everywhere. I dont just not recommend this game i dont even know why the **** it was even eccepted through the steam greenlight what why 1 vote of a guy that has 9 accounts and works for rockstar games? i have said all i will say if you want 100 more reasons on why this game sucks **** add me as a friend and type to me 'i want 100 reasons on to why this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game sucks* thank you Also for a cheaper and better version of this game just use the GTAVOnline gamemode for garrys mod its pretty good and $80 less.

2015-10-05,304930,True,"I love this game its very creative and fun, but in the  new 3.0 update its missing one thing that the 2.2 has... HOST! it needs a host button! because all the local servers are either pvp/laggy/lost of people and me and my friend dont like that so, games good keep updating but add a host button! it would help alot! thanks                                                                                                                                        -CBR1000RR"
