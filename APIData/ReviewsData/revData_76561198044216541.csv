Only issues include unexplainable frame rate drops and the AI of the game being a little lackluster, aswell as the 'Auto resolve' on conflicts doing unexplainable random things such as loosing a fight with 90% victory estimation. However when you manually control conflicts the system works perfect. 9/10 very enjoyable."
