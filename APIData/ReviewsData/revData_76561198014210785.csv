2016-03-09,409590,True,"One of my favourite games so far for this year and it has a hell of a lot of potential, with a decent amount of current playable content. If you enjoy First person sandbox survival RPG's with a strong crafting base, then please read this review.Pro's and Con'sFirst Person Sandbox Survival RPG- A rewarding leveling system, where your choices influence your ability to construct a variety of building, affecting in turn what you can craft.- Mount and Blade type of atmosphere with animals, survival and settlement building thrown in.- Procedurally generated world, will the slaughter of bears never end  ?! mwahahahar...- The world regenerates, trees will grow over time, ores will reappear somewhere and animals respawn- A tad buggy.. some Animals will be invincible ( FLEE, run for your life, ... this bear isn't taking any damage ) but when you find a Wildberry bush that has an enormous amount of fruit to give you won't complain hahahah nomnomnom..- Some perks are ineffective, or rather do not give you the listed bonuses, such as Yager and Skinner.- So i've built a Settlement... but im rather alone.. /tumbleweeds... how do we attract people to our Settlement ? good question :P This is why I suggest starting at another Settlement and expand with them for now.- Framerate issues / Lag.  It's an issue for quite a lot of folks.  I will suggest you Choose 'Fastest' for Video / Graphics options when you run the game.  Try removing the Bloom setting in game as well.Firstly.. choosing your beginning perks with the 20 points you get.. well, much can be said here, but i'll try to spare you some time.  I understand a lot of people will do w/e they like and discover what works for them. I've started several times myself in order to either dump a corrupt save and start again or retry new perks from the beginning. The faster you get exp the better imho ( in my honest opinion )I recommend starting with Chopper, Scholar & Scrivenr ( giving you a 25% exp bonus )You will start at a random point on the map with an Axe, a sword and a torch. Allow me to give you some advice on where to go from here..  Look around and find a tree that is NOT near a bear hahahah... no seriously.. you need to make a bow and arrows..TAB opens your inventory and the one the left hand side you'll find tabs, the topmost tab is your inventory, pickup and place the axe in your left-most hand slot to equip it, close inventory with TAB again and press 2 to weild the Axe.  Walk over to the tree or Hold Left Shift while you move ( W,A,S,D ) towards it to run.  When you reach the tree a circle will appear for your aiming reticle signalling that you are in range to begin harvesting it.  Chop Chop Chop.. ( hold left mouse ) you'll notice the circle filling slowly... when it fills you will receive 1 Wood ( 2 x wood and chopping speed if you chose the Chopper perk ).When you've fulfilled your lumberjacking fantasies enough ( 6 wood is a good enough start ) you open your inventory again and pick the tab at the bottom for crafting, choose to craft on the right hand page without a bench and you turn wood into planks 1 wood = 5 planks = 1 self crafted wooden bow,  1 plank = 1 arrow etc, leave the arrows in your inventory while you are crafting more arrows and they will continue to stack to 20.Place your new bow in the left slot and the arrows in the right slot and you are ready to hunt bears ( cackles maniacally )Lets face it.. in this game there's no point hunting anything but the creature that gives you the most EXP.  Bears will give you 200 exp without any of the Scholar tree perks.  Press 2 to wield the bow, click ( or hold ) the RMB ( right mouse button ) to prepare the bow for firing in your other hand and hold RMB to arm an arrow and raise the bow. Now at this stage you can either click LMB to fire or unhold RMB to lower the bow thereby not wasting the arrow.  Alternatively you can use LMB holding down to ready the bow and release to fire the arrow, but you cannot lower the bow from this stance and save the arrow.Find a Settlement asap ( M to open map.. if it looks like a Chapel ( not a greek Pantheon ) run to it,  the faster you get there the sooner you can begin to take quests from the board, earning you gold and exp. I have personally not experienced any reputation / Fame increments from completing quests for the population, but i've been more of a wanderer around the map, searching for a perfect place to build my own settlement.Now you're ready to explore.. make a name for yourself in this world of infinite bears... will you become Master of the hunt, roaming the land and setting up rudimentary shelters to rest before you again set off to explore.. Or will you become Jack of all Trades, buying from towns, crafting their produce into something better to resell again elsewhere. Or an owner-builder taking a piece of land for yourself and establishing a Settlement, building it the way you see fit. ?Either way this game is certainly a great way to spend your days, immersed in the survival, crafting and hunting. Pick it up and see for yourselfIn this Early Access state I give it a 6 / 10.  The more content and patches it receives, the better. Good luck out there, may the wilderness be gentle with you ^_^"
2016-01-07,368750,True,"As an Early Access game that was only $5 I am thrilled with this little gem of a Space MMO RPG. If this Genre of game interests you then please take the time to read this review.The short of it.This game has come to PC and other platforms from facebook and 'app status' - it is being remodelled and improved for us as we speak and has enormous potential to steal you away from reality.- 3 Races to choose from. Humans, Borguzands and Kriptizids.- A Variety of classes / ship types to pilot, each with their own unique abilities. Sniper, Tank, Engineer and Trooper- A shared bank facility for your characters, even across races.- An auction house for the budding traders amongst us.- Crafting of modules for your ship with randomized stats and bonus abilities providing you with an almost unlimited number of builds to aim towards and test at your leisure.- Mining either with your ship, up close and personal with the asteroids to collect ores or by placing Mining stations in the contested sectors to collect nebula elements for your passive skills.- PVP / PVE yes this game is not always safe, if you're a desk flipper / screen thrower you may wish to bring teddy along for some much needed cuddles.- Real time combat with players.- Form a Coalition amongst the players in your Race and strive towards gathering enough votes to become the Leader of your Race !- Leveling from 1-30 in however you choose. PVP / PVE ( currently no Quests - work in progress )- lvl 20+ a daily instance will be available for you and your Coalition friends to combat waves of AI ships your own level to receive items, experience and credits based on how long you can survive ! ( Instance is a work in progress )When / If you purchase and download this game strap yourself in, grab your snacks and a beverage of your choice, you wont be moving from that chair for quite some time. ^_^Clearly I am excited about this Indy title and I hope some of you folks out there get on board and give this Early Access game a try.  The developers are very involved with it as you will see if you join us on the Discussion boards.If you made it this far, then thankyou for reading and I hope to see you in the game. : )Antediluvian lvl 30 Rakhgals, Borguzand Coalition Leader of Annihilation"
2016-03-16,427910,True,"This is a great little dungeon crawler type game.. well in this case you climb Zavix Tower.  Old school RPG stype starting with a Warrior, Rogue, Mage and Cleric.  There are micro transactions sure, you'll receive a flashing icon in the top left of your screen, if you're not interested in paying, dont.  I am enjoying the game and I haven't lost a character yet, there is absolutely no need for the gems / ingame currency.  This game is fully playable without spending, I want to make that perfectly clear, this is NOT a money grab.  It is a wonderfully constructed old school RPG that will find a slot in your day when you want to hit some baddies with your crew of bearded ladies and hunched over old cronies tossing fireballs and smiting your foes ! Each floor will give you the opportunity to return back to town or climb the next level, but once you go up, you must reach the next level of stairs to go back, so do not make that decision lightly, and you'll love this game.  Make good choices, think ahead..Love it 8/10"
2014-06-15,259680,True,"I have been searching for an old school brutal RPG for so long that I had almost given up, until now.  Everthing about this game speaks of patience, time and careful  development.   The developer/s have clearly played a vast array of games themselves and have created a game that will speak to the sophisticated RPG'er who isn't solely drawn to graphical thrills. The depth of character development and it's importance to your longevity in the game world is something I cannot stress you enough to take your time with.This turn based RPG is unforgiving and it's game types and difficulties are designed to help you learn to survive.  There is no 'Loading a save game'  when you're about to be 2 hit by a unique boss twice your lvl who has just seen you, warped behind you cackling with glee at it's next meal.  Brutal, ingenious and rewarding, this game will challenge you to develop strategies just get out alive more often than being concerned about killing your foe.You only have so many lives Adventurer.98 / 100"
