2012-09-16,206440,True,This game might not have th best graphics but it is by far one of the most moving stories I have ever known. It holds a Epic level of story telling that Game of thrones books have.The game is only 4 hrs long but you cannot pass something so amazing I wish I had $10 to send it to everyone. Now consider me a FreeBirdGaming Groupie
