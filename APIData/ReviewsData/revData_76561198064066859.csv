2016-06-29,406150,True,I really enjoyed this game. It was quite definately worth the $1.50 I payed for it. The music is great and the atmosphere is as well. I just feel like the movement can be a little sluggish and clunky at times but other than that I full heartedly recomend this game to anyone looking for a short but fun and interesting game.
