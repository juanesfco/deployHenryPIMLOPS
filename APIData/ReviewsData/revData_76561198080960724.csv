My only issue with this game is that because so many people had a dummy spit about the new patch (which I wasn't here before the new patch came out so IDK the difference) it is hard to find games. And I keep having to change my region to North American to find matches. Hopefully people come back and play the game more, so it's easier to find matches. Keep up the good work, 9/10."
