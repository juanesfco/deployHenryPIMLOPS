2015-01-29,33930,True,Best game 10/10 cant beat it life is fun but mostly dayz overpoch
2016-07-25,252490,True,Rust (Legacy) would have to my favorite survival game by far. New rust would be in my top 5 but if you played legacy it doesnt even come close to being as good. Rust is a great game i would highly recommend anyone to get it soak up lots of hours make friends and have a great time.
2014-07-26,304930,False,so many people think this game is good but when u think of it its really bad its for for 30 mins thats about it. the game is a big let down
2015-07-25,314660,True,So ive only play like an hour but still i can tell that it will be a very good remake and i usally dont like remakes but if you really liked the 1st game or even the second i would recommend this game. Bought back some great childhood memorys back when i 1st play the 1st one on ps1.
