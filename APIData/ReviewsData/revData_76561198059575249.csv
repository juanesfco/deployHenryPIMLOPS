Easy to control,fast,moderate health,long distance attacks and most of the time 1-2 shots kill,that being said,most of the servers will be about snipers trying to camp outside of the enemy base before the others,and after that,the next 20 minutes of the game are about snipers spawn-camping.What else? Lag,lots of. In games like CS GO I usually get 90 ping,but in every server in AoS I'll probably get 120 if lucky.Conclusion: Don't buy this game unless you have friends to play,if that's the case,you can get about 3 hours of fun from this game. 3.5/10"
