2016-01-26,292030,True,"The level of detail in this game is phenomenal, the devs are nice people, and have given out 15 or so free pieces of DLC simply as a thank you for playing the game. There is barely anything I can complain about (Maybe it would have been better to assign different buttons to interacting and talking, as there is so much to interact with when I try mount my horse Geralt puts out a candle or talks to a villager with 2 lines of dialogue). Buy it, you won't regret it."

2014-04-21,210770,True,"Sanctum 2 successfully merges fps and tower defense games. The multiplayer is fun, the graphics are good and it is enjoyable to play. Enemy types vary and require different tactics to defeat, making you plan your towers, weapons and perks carefully. I would've liked to see upgrading your primary and secondary weapons through the game, and a selection of primary weapons for each class, but it doesn't bug me too much. The story is barely there, with about two comic-like pictures before each level, and besides the map and enemies, gameplay doesn't change much between levels. Sure, you get new towers, secondary weapons and perks as you go along, but I was hoping on each level that some flying spaceship thing would come and help. The boss fights are really fun, as the boss destroys your buildings and fuels your rage to  destroy it. Without any expansions the story is short aswell, but it does get hard and can take a bit of grinding. The amount of detail put into each map is brilliant aswell, with little bits to explore and objects to interact with. Overall, this is a nice game to play with your friends, by yourself and sometimes with random people over the internet (Unless they hop in on the last wave, destroy all your towers before you notice and have time to act, then leave). 7.5/10"
