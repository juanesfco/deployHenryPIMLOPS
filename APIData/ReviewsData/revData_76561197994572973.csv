2016-04-20,374320,False,"My review will be negative until they fix all of the game's crippling performance issues.FROM software said that if you could play Scholar, then you could play DS3 just fine. My FPS in Scholar was constantly 60, yet in DS3, it drops down to less than 10, depending on where I'm looking!DS3 even auto calibrated my settings to high, indicating that I SHOULD be able to run the game effectively at those settings, yet the game still suffers terribly. Even when all of the settings are changed to LOW, the performance doesn't change! This means that there are serious problems originating from the developers, and that they must be fixed before you consider purchasing this game.Stay clear for now."
2014-04-17,221910,True,"The Stanley Parable is one of those rare, modern, alternative gems in the video gaming industry. For those of you who are sick of the typical first/third person shooter, or any action game in general, The Stanley Parable will have you laughing your ♥♥♥ off, as you explore the deep, intricate, narrator driven storyline that explores the mundane life of a measley office worker named Stanley on his grand quest to find out why all of his co-workers have suddenly, and mysteriously, disappeared.10/10, must play."
2013-12-31,233250,True,"It's an alright game so far, but I must say, it is a bit 'spammy', as in, the fights don't feel that tactical or strategic, and are more based on how many units you blob towards your opponent in a single attack."
2014-04-20,271290,False,"Besides generally ok gameplay, the game's support system is woefully slow, as seen for an issue regarding a glitch that charged me twice as much to purchase a mech, and yet I haven't heard back from their team in over 2 days.When a game's store function is coded badly enough for it to randomly charge you double for things especially when what has been doubled is REAL monetary cost, and the support team can't even be arsed to get back to you, then you know you've got a poor game on your hands."
2013-06-29,231430,True,"A very fun sequel to the first CoH. Visual effects and game mechanics are even more beautiful and nuanced than ever, serving to immerse you deep within ceaseless combat. I swear I actually feel cold during the blizzards... They're just so realistic! Definitely a must buy"
