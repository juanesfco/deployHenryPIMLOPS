2015-09-08,291480,False,"fast paced game. maps are pretty small. you can basically cross map kill some one with a pistol. the hitmarkers are massive, as in covering the screen. i got killed because the hitmakers are massive it covered the enemy.pay to win filth! play like planetside 2 or CS:GO, even minecraft is better better than this filth. you will pay about $20 in total just buying essentials. don't get this filthy game!"

2015-10-01,391460,False,"WHAT EVER YOU DO DON'T GET THIS GAME! if you have seen the trailer it's fake! they got a pro player playing it (maybe even a developer). The hitboxes are a a massive lie! go get CS:GO instead heaps better game.browsing the steam store looking for a good game.i stumbled across a game call WARMODE i take a look at it, downloaded it because it only took 5 mins.i ask lord Gaben if this game comes in good, he only said sorry this game only comes in: can't launch game without crashing, 300 ping on every server (mainly because i live in Australia), can't access the main menu, can't access the options or faulty hitboxes.so basically the game comes in bad or really bad right?yeah pretty much, go play CS:GO instead of this filth!"
