2015-10-28,238910,True,"This game was not what I expected. It's turn based, but play moves very quickly. One action of any type is a turn, so it plays out more like a semi-realtime game. The mechanics seem a little bewildering at first and the lack of a real tutorial puts the barrier to entry a little higher than many people will be able to handle. If you can get past that and spend a mission or two figuring out how it all works, there's a fantastic strategy title here."
