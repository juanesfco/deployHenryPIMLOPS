2013-11-28,227680,False,StarForge has this idea of digging and living in the worlds you create. There is nothing to do in this game. It can hardly run and crashes often. You can not even dig. The backbone of the game is not even in the steam version. I would say wait for this game and see what comes of it but that would be waiting another year? Why is this even in early access.
2013-11-28,236510,False,The game had a good idea but it does not work. It is sad to see a cool idea not work but this game is boring and has no gameplay value. To play this game for more then a hour NOT in the title screen is a god damn achivment. ((DO NOT BUY THIS GAME))
2013-11-28,244850,True,"THIS GAME IS GREAT. This game with everything thats in it, you can play forever. BUT IT IS NOT EVEN A FULL GAME YET. This game is in early access and is one of the best early access games you can get. Super fun gameplay. Multiplayer is soon to be added. and cool building mechanics. ((BUY THIS GAME))"

2016-05-12,379720,True,"I have completed the story campaign and I loved it. Fast paced and non stop action. Best part of the game is stomping demons head off, I am left wanting more. I am looking forward to making some maps in snapmap and seeing what people do with it."
2013-11-28,24240,False,"Payday is a grind of a game. Before the wolf pack DLC the heists were beatable. But now they just crank up the level and make it so hard it becomes unplayable. Payday 2 is FAR better but I wish they would make it more about stealing money and not shooting wildly at cops. Maybe someday there will be a perfect heist game,"
