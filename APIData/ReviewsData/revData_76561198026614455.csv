A good challenge, no tips every five secconds, battling other armies on planet then sending your forces to other planets via teleportation is sweet and the campaing needs a little bit more content.None the less, the game looks amazing and plays well, i only wish more of my friends had this so i could annihilate them too."

2014-06-23,48240,True,"this is by far one of the most complicated ubisoft rts games i have seen by far, not only do you make a city but the changes and sides you choose alter the gameplay dramatically"
2014-06-23,40100,True,"really fun real time stratergy that is incredibly quick than the last one, should've had the same tier three systems as the last one did but it still made up with its amazing graphics"
2014-04-18,17410,True,"A first person Park-hour game that actually works, who would have thought."
2014-03-05,49520,True,"Amazing re-playable campaing, amazing guns that can be randomly generated so no gun is the same, the dlc is just the campaing waited to be unlocked and played (recomending waiting for sales), enemies are insane once you get to a higher level and evolve to your specific level, loot = infinite and once you get that gun (people who have played it know what i mean) ..... just buy the game"
