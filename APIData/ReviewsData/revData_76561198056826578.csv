2016-03-20,365590,False,Hit level 30 and grind in the Darkzone on mobs because dying rouge or just to NPCS makes you lose 1-3 ranks and 20% DZ Credits. Missions that make you Zzz and horrible end game. S A D A G E N T S.
2015-07-01,282900,True,"Highly recommended if you love JRPGS and stupid corny animay jokes. I learnt how to nep a nep, how to search dungeons for hours looking for new dungeon plans and how to grind on polytans to get everyone to max level. Most importantly I dissapointed my friends and family even further.Ps- Blanc best girl"
