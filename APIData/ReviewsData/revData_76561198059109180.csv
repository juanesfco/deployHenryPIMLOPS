2014-07-17,4700,True,This Game is Amazing!  Even though it's 8 years old it's graphics are still fine and this is probably a personnal thing but i found the Medieval setting way cooler then a Roman setting with the awesome knights just mowing down peasants.The one problem like all other Total War games is that there are a few ai bugs that can be annoying but over all this game is just awesome and my favourite in the franchise.
