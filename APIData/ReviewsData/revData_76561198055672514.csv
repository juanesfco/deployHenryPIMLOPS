2015-11-03,401920,True,"This dlc is by far the best I have seen in any game, it brang so much more potential and I honestly think it was great. New music (Which I LOVE) A few new bosses, new items which are amazingly useful, and the best of all, GREED MODE! I love doing runs on greed mode these days, I've tried doing it with every character but alas was not successful. I rate this dlc 9/10. I would definitely recommend buying it. It is worth the money."
