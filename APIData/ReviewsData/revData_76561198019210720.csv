2015-05-20,351290,True,"To tell you the truth, this game actually has major potential. I mean, it runs smoothly most of the time, and only having a dot on your screen for  aiming makes game-play kinda freaky, especially all you can hear when hiding is other peoples footsteps coming towards you. It needs a chat box at least, and ways to change your weapon easily. Other than that the game is K and it didn't give me cancer like I thought it would based on the game's name and description (Which is pretty ♥♥♥♥-poor to read which needs fixing)."
