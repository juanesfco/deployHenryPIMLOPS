Don't Starve is just weird, based on the creatures, or the characters. Its just unique. (I forgot how to spell it) The scary parts of the game like the night time, the creatures, and the mod. I love the chraracters, cause each of them have their own powers, especially Wendy. And i love BEEFALOS, I HAVE TO KILL THEM ALL!!!! MWAHAHAHAHAH! By the way, buy this game. You will like it. Money well spent!"
2014-10-11,440,True,"The first person shooter (sorta), free to play game that never gets old. There is always new ways to win the game (or fail), new tactics, trolls, and stuff that can happen in any match you play. Waste your money by buying the extremely expensive cosmetics, or be a smart person by buying cheaper stuff on the community market instead. Y'know, Gaben should've been more generous, but still. Download this game, and waste your life by playing it in an exceedingly large amount of time."

You still can shoot peoples, even when you lose your head. Holy ♥♥♥♥! You have to play this game bro! 10 out of ♥♥♥♥ING 10!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)"
2014-10-12,304930,False,"Don't waste your time playing this piece of trash... The graphics are the worst, hard too play with people, the Zombies make you rage, and when the hunger and the thirst pain makes it even worse... How come you become hungry/thirsty for 5 minutes? Doesn't make any sense.. Potatus.exe says No. :("
2014-10-12,224260,False,Not one of the best... Im disapointed in this game.... How come do you walk so slow and run like you are walking normally... Potatus.exe says No. :(
2015-05-25,230410,True,"Awesome gameplay. More like, futuristic ninja style!"
2015-02-28,238460,True,"Wow. This game is such a badass platform game. I think this is the best platform game in Steam. It is very creative, funny, and a little bit gore actions. Just some bones that flew around the map. And, some blood. But still! Its good for kids! I recommend you to buy this game, but be patient playing it! Its hard! You can also change your head, and weapons. From box shaped heads to triangle heads? Ilumminati confirmed? Naaah, its not. But still, its a cool game! Buy this! Trust me, its a good game. Oh yeah, i forgot about the ratings. 10/10 of course!"
2015-01-23,113400,False,"Worst gameplay ever. Didn't find enemies that is in my level. Gameplay sucks, graphics... Well they're almost good, weird things, hard to find ammo box and car depots, very confusing on the tutorial it doesnt help. I recommend no..."
2014-10-11,620,True,"I dont know why much people in my School hates it. But no, not me. This game is one of my favs. Its very creative, nice and cool, and it can even make you smarter. My iq raised from 2 too 35 cause this game. Its an addictive game, makes you always wanted too solve its puzzles, but sometimes can make you mad if you are an unpatient gamer. Be patient on this one. Potatus.exe says Yes... :)"
2014-10-11,570,True,"Looking for a MOBA game that includes expensive items in it? Then look bo further, Dota 2 is the game you're looking for! Waste some time by playing this game. Includes custom games in it! That is sometimes random and sh*t! Get mocked by Russians, and Philippine peoples! (♥♥♥♥ blyad, or bobo, uhm... tangina.) Any of that. Get scammed by random players you play in a game. Be a carry, that everyone will blame you if you don't help them win the game. Waste some money to buy items that changes the way your hero cast a spell, or add some infusion to make that item glow. Or buy parts from a set on the community market, that IS totally cheaper. Dota 2, the game that makes you.... Poo(?)"
