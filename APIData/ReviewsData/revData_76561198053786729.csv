2015-09-20,34870,True,"A good game overall 7.5/10. The story is alright(a bit short). gameplay is great although playing on the hardest difficulty was a little easy(personaly), but also has good replayability. annnnd the multiplayer is dead with no dedicated servers anymore, but finding the odd game with a few people is still fun for a few hours."
