2016-09-03,398850,True,I do recommend this if you're good at typing. I am not.The game looks nice (it looks like paper) and the story looks ok BUT if you are a slow typer (like me) the game can be a bit hard.The keys are a bit odd (wasd or efji) and I felt there was very little help (you see the word when you hit space and find out you need to type that word to grow/kill what the item is). One thing that bugged me was as I typed the word the keys to moved keep poping up or swaping to show the other set.I got this as part of the Humble Bundle Monthly and is the only reasion I give it a thumbs up is coz I kind of payed for it but had no choice in the games I got.
2016-07-11,334230,True,You can play this for free. I payed for it (after being told about it) and have not looked back yet. I'll start with if you pay you will get some free in game gold (I think it's about 2000 gold) or you can play for free on the webpage and earn the gold the slow way. The gold is used to buy visual things (new looks and houses)I love this game. In the 4 times I have played it I have a score one 2 W and 2 L and lived passed day 1 once. Some times it's more fun to be dead (they have threre own chat and only the dead and medium and see that chat). The fun part of this game is picking who you think is who and having great players who keep the fun going well after you die. I have no regreats and ask that if you like it you buy it (if only for a little extra gold)
