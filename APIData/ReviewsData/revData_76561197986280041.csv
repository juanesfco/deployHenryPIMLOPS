Call me a ♥♥♥♥♥, tell me play it on easy, insist I creep around and take 30mins to get from one room to another, I just just don't care any more.The back-tracking, the lack of save points, I just don't know what it is but it makes me ANGRY!!!  I'm deleting it now from my PC a second time and I tell you now, it's not getting a third chance."
