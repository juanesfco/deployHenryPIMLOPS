2015-01-10,4000,True,"MAN! This game has got to be my most favourite game of all time (you can probably tell from the amount of hours played :D). It is my most favourite game because it is extensive and fun because of the amount of content it provides. This content includes downloadable maps, weapons, vehicles and more from the in - game workshop and plentiful servers to play on. I would definitely recommend it to any that is thinking of getting it because it is worth your time and your money. Pros  A workshop that contains TONS of varied addons to download Plentiful servers to join  Plentiful gamemodes to play Very good game to play with friends (especially on certain maps) It is extremely funny because of the physics and addons The game runs easily, even if you have a bad computer  You can spawn in things other people have made  Cons  The graphics aren't amazing but acceptable The servers on Gmod use a lot of CSS (Counter Strike Source) textures, meaning that you need to buy CSS to see the textures. Although, you don't need to do this but it is recommended because it will enhance the experience For new players, setting up a private server to play with friends may be hard (I watched tutorials on YouTube on how to do it) Some addons take a while to download (especially the larger file size addons) and servers that you join require you to download the server's addons / content. Although, it really depends on the speed of your internet if it's going to be fast or slow.Overall this game is worth it and it's only $10 ........ $10 FREAKIN BUCKS!!!!!!! :DGmod receives a final overall score of 8/10"
