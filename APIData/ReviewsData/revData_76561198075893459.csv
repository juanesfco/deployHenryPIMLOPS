I realise im running out of supplies on the first island, so i decide to take the life raft to the closest island (there is a glitch where the boat will disappear in the water i have no clue wtf it is) the boat disppears... i then swim for the next 5 minutes to find that i was being stalked by a Tiger shark.I proceed to gather as much as i can carry into 1 pile of loots, i then make a wooden raft hoping that it would be able to get me back to my start island. As before... the boat disappears.... It then starts raining and i cant see anything because the fog is covering everything. I then get hurt from behind so i turn.... 4 Tiger sharks, all trying to take a big chunk of meat out of me... I ♥♥♥♥ myself and get out my machete, i manage to kill all the sharks only taking half health damage. This is the point im up to in Stranded Deep A.K.A Shark killing simulator. P.SI still dont know which way to head...."
