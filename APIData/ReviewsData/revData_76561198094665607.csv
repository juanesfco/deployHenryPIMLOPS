2015-11-18,377160,True,"Fallout 4 is a must have for anyone who has played Fallout 3 or New vegas.The game has a new amazing crafting system with the guns, melee weapons and armor. Although there arent to many guns in the game.While writing this review i have around 30+ hours on the game and have finished the main story which in my opinion was pretty short. before going out and exploring i recommend doing a few main quests first and then start the exploring."
