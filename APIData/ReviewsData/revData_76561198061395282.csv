2015-09-21,278460,False,"I got this game for free on a site  that I used to buy Steam Games cheaper so here are my Good, Mediocore and Bad. I am an avid RPG/JRPG game who used to play Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger when I was younger and still play them to this day sometimes.Good:Characters - I actually like these characters, great backstory wished they introduced characters more clearly than rushing them.Mediocore:Music - It's okStory - It's kinda messed up as you get thrown into different scenarios and I partially have no idea whats going onArtwork- Although decent but kinda plainBattle System- Quite nice of adding in a Threat system. Thinking of my way through of how to deal with my enemies but that was quickly overlooked aka get the guy who has the most hp finishing off the enemy so he takes damaged while keeping the damaged dealing with hp sustain and weakening the games. Also my characters get KO in battle unfairly: Gouge- Me: Chance of blinding a person with an attack. Monster: Chance of Blinding the enemy with a chance of KO.Bad:ITS FEELS SHORT - I take my sweet as time when learning a new RPG game but dam the short feeling is strong here.CURRENCY IS REDUNDANT- You can basically survive off the items that you find instead of buying them, there are plenty HP/MP restore points in the game.Boss Battles: Feeling extremely boring and easy heck Yakra gave me a harder time than the first couple bosses combined. In short if you were buying this game don't buy it at full price its not worth it."
