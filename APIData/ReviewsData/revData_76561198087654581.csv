I haven't Played this DLC much, YET!!!!, so i cant review all the items for him now. This guys starting magic power is a... i have no idea what you call them but there is a large one at the black smith, (on the map) ok (you can go there by the map) well you have a smaller one that you spawn in for 2 or 3 seconds and it hits the mosters/guys in frount of you with its tongue and ita ♥♥♥ can hit people behind you (if they're close). The next magic upgrade, is a throwing flamming hammer and it sets them on fire, duuurrrrr! also its a ranged attack.... thats it for magic. Your starting weapon is a hammer with +3 attack and -1 agility.And Thats what i think about this epic DLC 9.5/10!!   "
