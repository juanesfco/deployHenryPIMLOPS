WHY!?!??!?!!??! But i havenm't played many civ like turn based strategies and i like this one... with mods of course."

Kid thought about giving up, going to sleep, eating something. Then the kid met Zia. Been hooked ever since. Can't stop singing its praise. Some people disagree with his opinion, saying he's an idiot. Kid don't care. 'I'll dig my hole you build a wall!' he shouts 'Some day that wall is gonna fall!' People say he's crazy. I say he's coming home."
