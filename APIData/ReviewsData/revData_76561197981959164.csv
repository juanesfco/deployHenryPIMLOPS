Find a solid building and make it a fortress, pillage as many resources as you can, there are plenty.  Great game, thanks for making it, the final version should be great!"

Zombies looks magnificent, multi player is great, no stuttering, no problem.  I really like it and need to say thankyou Treyarch for building this awesome game, well done guys! Love it.  Buy it"

If you like a good story and some good action this game is a must for any noob who doesn't know what half life is.This is THE game that got me into PC shooters almost 10 years ago.  I've played the hell out of it and now that I've found this co-op mod I'll be trying my hardest to convince my gamer GF to do a play through with me as she's never played it...  yeah, I'm shocked and appalled about that too.  Buy it NOW!"
