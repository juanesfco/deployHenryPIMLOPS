Aside from that it’s visually beautiful, controls are perfect & the setting/mood that it creates makes me just love it.8.5 / 10 StarsBuy it, play it, love it"

Oh well this is the first time its running so its ok'. Then you get into the beat of the music and it lags so bad, the camera angle spasses out and you say 'S#it s#it s#it! I hope that dosn't happen often' (It does) And then it crashes.0.5 / 10 StarsBad"
