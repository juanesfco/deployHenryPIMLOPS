I recommend joining a realisim unit or a group of peeps who play this often, so you can get the most fun out of it.you also may want to consider to buy the DLC bundle for maximum DLC and freedom euphoria.Getting a new PC just for this game.A GTX 970 will do it! (hopefully)10/10 would buy all the DLC and shizz.P.S. you need a good rig to make this game look amazing, otherwise it's pretty standard."
