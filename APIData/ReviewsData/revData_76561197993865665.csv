2013-10-22,49520,True,"This game holds 3rd place for most hours I've put into a single IP (after FFVII and TF2). Great fast paced gameplay, well written dialogue and storyline, well constructed quests and tonnes of developer support and expansion. What more could you really want? (no you can't have a puppy, or a meat bycycle)"
