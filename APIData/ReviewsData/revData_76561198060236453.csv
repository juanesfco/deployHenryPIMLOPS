2016-05-21,41070,False,"This game is completely unplayable for me.The game always freezes at certain points, forcing me to manually turn my computer off and on from its power button.I have tried disabling its auto save feature, uninstalling and reinstalling the game, deleting the game’s files from my PC, etc. but nothing seems to help.Therefore I cannot recommend this game until this issue gets fixed (which it probably won’t).
