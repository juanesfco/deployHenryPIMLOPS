2014-06-26,220160,True,"This is a really fun game, but it can be frustrating at times. This game never stops providing challenges to the player. There are a range of bikes and costumes for your racer! It also has a level editor, so you can make your own maps and publish them for other players to download. This game is also fun when playing with friends."
