2013-11-26,35450,True,I think that this is one of the best first person shooters thus far. The two elements of gameplay that I like the most are the focus and morale systems. With focus you can slightly zoom in; like you are leaning in to your sight on your gun. With the morale if you see your men die in front of you your character gets shakey. Overall I think it is a really good game and I agree with the developers that COD has ruined a generation of shooters. For the price this game is well worth it.GET IT! RIGHT NOW!
