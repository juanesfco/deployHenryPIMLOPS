2016-02-28,235540,False,"Terrible loot system that breeds toxicity. one can play a 1k hours and still not get 2 or 3 trinket esential for high difficulty level, never mind the fact one need to play those levels for such loot. So far after 200+ hours, only 3 headgear, 2 for a character i played 3 times and 1 for my main.  Amongst the plethora of customization the devs made, they block it all with RNG like some cheap F2P devils.Dying population not addresed with maps or mods.New dlc lackluster and wrecks balance for some items.Here's hoping the devs have some sense to see this situation. Here's a thumbs down for the point."

2014-04-12,238430,False,"Jump(or rather, tripping) over to full release from early access; that's what it is. Player model turned uglier. Zombie still have floaty head hitboxes, persistant from EA. There's very little escape map for coop enthusiast and even to that, you get player enemy when they die or infected if you so careless to get your clothe's thread hit. New escape map has poor item drop and many zombies, even melee, as a form of completion deterrent. A cheap game padding due to lack of maps instead of meaning, challenging obstacles. Say, challenging? They added an armored zombie that will eat up all your ammo-not that you have any. Pvp enthusiast? Bring your team to the game or face outnumbered in a hunt game, a solo free for all(save the group which the game has no fail safe over). ZPS enthusiast? This isn't the game. There's no weight system so everyone hoardes everything. Melee isn't skill based, but fail-to-be-based. There's no physics-based barricade and game is slower with worst tick rates. Those who still cares, forum moderators now are going full out, trigger happy post deletion, thread locking mania. You wanna post? Better be positive or tatsuro will delete it. You got opinions on game? 'Well it's just your opinion'-actual quote from another dev."
2015-07-14,333930,False,It's good. Splash Damage got the sense to nerf OP character after release. Hopefully their publisher wont repeat it for quick cash grab.But now it's infested with hackers. It's going down the road to ruin and Nexon doesn't seem to give a damn. No action from reports made.Combat arms all over again?update: They released new anti-cheat. Don't know if it combats the rampant insta-kill hacks. But now it kicked me 3 times in an hour. Zero mission progress.Still zero team balance.Zero team jumping restriction.Zero skill balance.Zero report function.Zero map addition.That's enough to rationalize my zero patience. I'm done.
