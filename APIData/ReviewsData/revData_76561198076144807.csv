Not like those games where they give you a ♥♥♥♥ weapon with hardly any ammo and you feel ♥♥♥♥ weak!!Hawken makes you feel  like an unstoppable action hero out for revenge and hellbent on destruction It certainly got the adrenaline pumping!!Reminded me a little of Armoured Core which made me think it would have been so cool if they took some inspiration from it and let you build your own mech."
