2011-11-05,1250,True,Simple yet with great replayability. In my opinion does 'zombie' hordes and team work better than left 4 dead plus has a global leveling system. Alot of down to earth 'zombie' splattering fun for the whole family. Amazed this sort of FPS is so rare.
2011-07-15,22200,True,It's unique and worth a playthrough.
2011-04-21,43110,True,Great atmosphere. The gunplay can be a bit chunky at times but at the end of the day this game is definitely worth it and I hope they do a sequel...so buy the game so I get a sequel!
