2014-09-30,251570,True,It's a fun game and the graphics is nice but there are things lacking like how come there are light poses that is working and some of the abandon house have power and you can only make a torch as a source of light and when you try to make one it wont work since there is no power.which doesnt really make sence but still this game is stil a beta i think it would be reasonable and i do hope that this game can have cars and some what have some power to have lights working and have more tools to increase the chance of survival also i hope that alot of guys like me would support this game to have it become one of the survival zombie game.
