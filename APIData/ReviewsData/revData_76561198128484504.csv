There also a mini game called triple triad if you played final fantasy 14 you'll know it's pretty fun xDStory: 8.5 story pretty good it's base on war and loveBattle: 8.5 cause I like games that don't use mana xD pretty much it's all about drawing and that how to incress your stats or use the magic you draw :3Music: 6 pref the classic Playstation 1 ver over PCGraphic: 7.5 It's pretty alright just wish it was for everything not just characters and monsters"
