It is in early alpha and it is hard to say whether I think it is worth waiting or picking up now.I personally find the game pretty fun and entertaining, but that is just my competitive side talking. The community is going to be a rough one. Lot of games with this 'Kill or be killed' mentality often have a horrible community starting out. Lot of people want to kill you because they are curious what you have and want to take it from you. It definitely brings the savages out in the world lol.I think, if you played DayZ, Minecraft and any other survival type game, you may like this game very much, but if the kill or be killed mentality is not for you.. then I would not recommend it. They have non PVP servers, so it may be an option, but majority are PVP.I really think the game needs a way to encourage people to work together, rather than get greedy and become savage bandits. But do so in a way, that does not affect the players negatively. I often like roleplaying with these kind of games, but due to the people out for blood, it makes the roleplay very difficult or impossible. You are just put in a tough decision to kill as self defence."

I have no problem with early access games if they follow a similar route with this. This should once again be  a clear example and proof that gameplay is more important than graphics. This game is not perfect, but it is much more fleshed out than the competition. Here is some positives and negatives.+You have skills like crafting, shooting, survival, outdoors, stealth, that you can increase with exp.+The map is a good size for now+You can craft and build houses with different items. Some recipes are unique.+The game offers a challenge+If you want basic roleplay and become a bandit, and kill other players, then you can+You can make use of your current groups on steam to build a faction+Did I mention it is free, with optional gold membership?-Multiplayer at the moment is pretty limited. I recommend evolve or Hamachi, as you cannot join servers unless you portforward- Crafting system is good, but a bit confusing at times. I have not quite figured it out. But I do enjoy the lack of handholding.- Zombies AI could use little improvements, overall it is good, but may be overpowered to some people. Melee weapon is required.-Graphics: Some people might find this a negative( I honestly do not), even though I think because of simple graphics, they are capable to deliver the great features. But some might complain it looks like kid's drawing. lol-Tutorial doesn't give you alot of gameplay elements you can expect in the game. Does not discuss most of the features.Aside from those, the game has a great start. I don't know if this is being developed by only one person, but if so..You manage to achieve the basic barebones of what is beginning of a game. Something I feel lot of these Zombie apocalypse survival games are not doing good at. They just have basic mechanics."
2014-03-23,238430,True,"Contagion isn't a game that 'has potential'. It already GOT Alot of Potential. It is not just  another mindless action zombie game like most FPS games with zombies have or DayZ wannabe. It goes back to the roots of survival. Most games with Zombies, do not contain enough survival elements anymore. This one brings that back  with the 3 game modes. Hunted being my favorite.One of the things is that this game does not try to be another DayZ or another FPS game with zombies mode. It is also not as sosphisticated and complex that games that try to copy those games.It has 3 simple objectives. Gather ammo and weapons. Fortify, and survive. They can expand on weapons and game modes, but because the game does not have a huge open world (Just good big maps), it isn't so hard to get confused."

2014-06-25,250180,False,"God this ♥♥♥♥ is awful. A big disgrace to Metal Slug fans. I doubt you will have too many problems playing singleplayer. But this as multiplayer is BROKEN!! It is out of sync with the other players, framerate issues, audio problems. Save yourself the money, even if it is a discount, and if a friend offers to buy it for you, save him money and say no."
