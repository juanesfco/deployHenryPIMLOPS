2014-05-29,202090,False,At the moment this game is quite ♥♥♥♥ as the servers are almost always down (due to the amount of players wanting to play) but playing it was quite enjoyable for the short amount of time i played it. It is a good idea to stay away from this game unless you like playing it or like seeing a game progress and evolve from a beta piece of crap into a lovely butterfly XD.
