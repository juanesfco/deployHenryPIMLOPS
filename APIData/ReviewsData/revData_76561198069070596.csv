2016-08-15,391540,True,This game is brilliant one of my favorite it is so fun even if you don't kill and there are beautiful places in this game and don't judge a game by it's graphics because even at full price this game would be worth it (I got it for $6.99 because it was on sale)
2016-04-18,291550,True,"It's a really good game fun but hard when you go online (but it could be I'm bad at the game), yes you could get super smash bros but this game is free and fun and this is coming from a person who doesn't use many microtransactions and the few I did use I regret and they whernt on this game"
