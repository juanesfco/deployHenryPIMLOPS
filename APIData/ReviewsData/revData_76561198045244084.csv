Unlike the organic progression in games like Minecraft where you discover recipes and crafting on your own, you walk around and kill random mobs and find recipes lying around. Theres no sense of awe in exploration and the game certainly isn't worth buying. Furthermore actually collecting resources is slower than an old-folks home on Christmas.4/10, its a great concept, a 3D Sci-fi survival game that's implemented about as well as Ubisofts everything with none of the polish"

2014-12-01,289130,True,"Fantastic 4X strat game, the factions that are available are interesting and the combats actually enjoyable, hands down my favorite 4X in regards to combats. That said, theres not all that many factions and while they are unique, are rather limited and the custom factions don't really add all that much freedom and it could be better in that regard. The same issue applies to units as well, each faction gets three unique units and faction heroes available for sale on the Merc Market tend to follow the same format based on their original faction as well.These downsides don't detract THAT much from the game however, its still a highly enjoyable experience and with modding being an option, its quite possible that this can be built upon."
