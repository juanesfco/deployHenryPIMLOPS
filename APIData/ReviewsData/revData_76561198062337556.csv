Like how are we supposed to win when he has 7 perks? Constant disconnections during a match and consistent failure to find games or the game simply returns you to the lobby after loading."

Now that I've been able to go through the entire game and finish it I see that it actually a pretty cool game. The story is the best part, some of the gameplay is a bit repeditive (killing demons) but overall I really enjoyed it. I did not see the end comming so it was a good mystery plot."
