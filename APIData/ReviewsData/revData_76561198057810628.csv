Well, this announcer is pretty much the closest thing, heaped with massive piles of vengeful cheese, it is both hilarious and very fitting for a Wraithlord Announcer. Well worth the money"

2015-06-20,65930,True,"The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a brilliant game. It isn't like Enemy Unknown, but it is an amazing XCOM game. It is a shame to see so many negative reviews, comparing it too heavily with Enemy Unknown, but it isn't Enemy Unknown. It is an entirely different game. It might not be Enemy Unknown, but it is XCOM, and it is good"
