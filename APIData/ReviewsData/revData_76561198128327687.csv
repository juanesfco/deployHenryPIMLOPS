2015-04-13,4000,True,Garry's mod is a creative sandbox game where you imagination is the limit and i'm not joking when i say its you imagination anything think you can think of can be in Garry's mod and i mean ANYTHING. but overall i would recommend garry's mod to anyone with a crazy imagination and twice the fun with friends
2015-04-13,230410,True,Warframe is not a player friendly game but if you have a friend who is already experienced with the game or you can just read 1 or 2 guides you will be fine but overal Warframe is Very fun if you wanna be a freking SPACE NINJA and murder fools with all maner of weapons and super powers.
2015-04-13,218230,True,"Planetside 2 is a Sci-fi MMO shooter with three factions fighting over a planet's resources and territory with many classes of military such as light assault, heavy assault, medic ect. if you have friends (the more the merrier) to play with you can create a squad and work together as a team. But overall it is fun if you comit a good amount of time and have a good squad you can have the best organised chaos in a MMO game, i would defenatly recomend Planetside 2 (it's free)"
