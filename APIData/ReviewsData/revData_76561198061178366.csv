It is amazing looking and the Systems, parkour and graphics all combined make a amazing game. although it is pay to win and there are a few hackers on it its still great. 4 out of 5"

2014-12-06,227940,True,"Its a great game, needs a couple tweeks as most early access games do. One thing i think it needs it a voice chat, perhaps its proximity chat so everyone around you can hear (including enemies) but definitly needs it. If its already in the game and i just cant figure it out please do tell me XD"

2015-04-28,730,True,"Amazing, tactical, Its a game that takes practise and lots of it to be good. Annoyingly the amount of hackers is quite annoying, ruins the competitive gameplay. Casual games are always fun, community is quite nice. Unless there is someone under the age of 12 playing, then everyone just becomes a community of yelling at 6-12 year olds to go back to CODBut ive found many people, friendly, willing to help and very patient."
