Ignore the negative reviews and go in with an open mind. It doesn't feel like a puzzle game at all regarding one of the other reviews"

If answered yes: Buy this game and enjoy!If answered no: Buy and finish HM 1 then buy this game and enjoy!By the way, after you finish, you will most likely be confused. Read the lore after you've finished both games and you will feel a lot better.(Pay attention to every character, even to the trippy store managers and how they relate in the sequel.)"
