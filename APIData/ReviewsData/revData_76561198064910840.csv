Stamina, strength, stealth, and lung capacity are joined by a meter for their special abilities. These impact how long you can run and swim, of course, but also impact how well you handle recoil, climbing speed, take-off and landing in planes and helicopters, and so much more. If you want to bump up your flying skills, logic follows that you head to flight school. Similarly if you’d like to have a bit more stamina, then riding bikes, triathlons, tennis, golf and other physical activities will help with that. Other than specialty skills, simply doing more of something makes you better at it – practice makes perfect. This is not an arbitrary add, but one with real.Also Graphically, Grand Theft Auto V makes the respectable presentation of its predecessor look pretty bland in comparison. What a difference five and a half years makes! Gone is the drab and depressing color scheme, giving players all the bright faux-California sun they can stand. Having lived in Los Angeles, many places in the world of Los Santos, San Andreas are familiar. The city itself is teeming with life, and I don’t just mean random pedestrians and cars roaming around. People go about their daily lives: traffic backs up, downtown is busy, Vinewood is full of shopping and mansions, Vespucci Beach has people skating and lifting weights, Blaine County is far more rural with rednecks and pink flamingos, and wind turbines spin in the distance like the real-world San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm. The whole place feels organic, looks the part, and is more like a living world than ever before."
2015-11-23,242050,True,"Here are just some of the things you can do in Assassin's Creed 4: climb a tower, hunt a whale, hide in a haystack, steer a ship in a storm, stick a sword through a man's eye socket, shoot an iguana, stab a shark, stand atop a church balcony and sprinkle coins onto the people below, regardless of their beliefs.But you can't just crouch when you want to, which seems a bit odd for a game that spins around sneaking, subterfuge and poking holes in the heads of a secret war between assassins and templars. The struggle for supremacy intersects with old-fashioned analogue piracy in Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag, which lets you sail across the massive caribbean, swim in its perfectly turquoise waters and make any treasure your own. Not having a squat button in the middle of a meticulous recreation of Havana is the ultimate first-world, 18th century problem.You do, however, bend your knees and lower your stance automatically as soon as you enter a bush, and the good news is these stealth shrubs are everywhere. Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag is a more honestly designed game than the last, appearing cognizant of where it needs to lay down some rug-shrubs to cover up the seams between – how many systems is it now? There's sword-fighting, pickpocketing, free-running, air assassinating, diving, sailing, eavesdropping, harpooning; all slave to another massive, richly rendered slice of history. And it's all the better for designers understanding the monster they've created."

2013-12-29,259080,True,"Totally awesome free roam game!There is one goal in this game,the goal is to make chaos everywhere you go!9/10"
2014-07-11,440,True,"The game is very well balanced with 9 classes with unique abilities and weaknesses. Valve continues to update and add more maps all the time. The animation and voice over work will have you chuckling as you intensely battle for intelligence and capture points.Also there are a lot of random gamemodes such as Deathrun,Jailbreak and so on...have fun!"
2014-11-02,206420,True,"Being properly, legitimately astonished by Saints Row 4 is an unavoidable eventuality inherent to the experience, but there's something to be said for going in completely blind, as I did. If at all possible, I highly recommend it – Volition's latest is a non-stop cavalcade of self-aware meta-humor and surprising, bombastic gameplay decisions from stem to stern, and to enter the experience with even the slightest knowledge of what's coming would be doing yourself a major disservice."
2014-11-02,221100,True,"DayZ is a standalone post-apocalyptic zombie survial horror game for the PC...A 225 km2 open world post-soviet state and one of the areas hit by a new and presently unknown infection which has wiped out most of the world's population.

2014-06-08,252490,True,"Rust is a game about survival,but that takes time! Initially, it's just about death. It's about freezing to death, and starving to death, being shot to death and getting bitten to death,I'm enjoying playing it so far!Rust's mix of DayZ and Minecraft!You can do a lot of things,crafting,hunting,building etc!The game is still in Alpha so...expect few bugs..for now..8.5"
