2014-03-28,20,False,"Just an overall great game, the graphics are phenomenal and the gameplay is incredible. I'm never bored and it is always jam packed with action and adventure. Each class is funner than the last and this the maps have never been better. The gameplay is absolutely amazing with the npc's always giving you a challenge and the graphics have never been better. It's like call of duty, But Better! And I didn't think that was possible. This game is just outstanding and quite frankly one of the best games I have ever played.Lol jk this game sucks my fat ♥♥♥♥0/5"
