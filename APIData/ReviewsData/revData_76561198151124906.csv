2015-06-25,344760,False,"devs jumped ship. shame really, i really thought this game was gonna be something awesome. they say it is complete to keep the naive people happy. game is laggy to the point where you are unable to fight (screen freezes, next thing you know your dead.) anyone who has sunk countless hours in to the game like myself will know what i am talking about. lots of bugs, and the wingers that would not shut up about the raiding (saying shiit like, the raiding is so op NERF IT!) but really they failed to defend their base and base design was flawed. running straight to the forums when they got raided, you also fuccked what was great about this game. pvp is not meant to be easy raiding is a part of the game and happens to everyone, if you can not handle it don't play pvp.unfinished + community full of bittches"
