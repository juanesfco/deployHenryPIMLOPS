2016-07-09,460120,True,i really enjoued the game it took about 17 hours to complete though i did find it a bit disjointed compared to other HDN games where you play with one main charicter and you dident lose them aditinally i found it suprisingly short compared to the other games in the series and lacking on content as the pan system was alot bigger and you had things like stelars dungeon yet it is still an extreemly good game and i would highly recomend purchacing it.
