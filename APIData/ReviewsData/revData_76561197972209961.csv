2014-11-20,219640,True,"I liked Chivalry, but then came the archers in numbers bound in worlds worth of size, not yet seen by mankind til this time. The flying projectiles manage to pin and penetrate endless numbers of good armour, and that armour took man hours to hammer away at clasps and all sorts of defence, and yet war is the answer. Archers if you are targeting the good souls in this world of turmoil and destruction, I am your enemy. Many a bow I have broken, and all shall be destroyed in my presence, lest you draw your arrows against any friend. Join me in the archer salvation, for it is a requirement to be fulfilled before the Chivalry may live on!"
