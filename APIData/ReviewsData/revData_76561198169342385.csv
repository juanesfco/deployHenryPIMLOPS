2015-04-22,4000,True,"With so many gamemodes and physics tools, this sandbox game is excellent value for money at the price. Roleplay servers are popular, things like cops and robbers, Half-Life 2 roleplay, and build mode servers. If it's on sale, pick it up, but keep in mind that the gameplay you get out is completely reliant on what you put in. This isn't a guided experience, this is creativity, and improvisationally based stuff."

We have to wait and see how it evolves, but the base concept leads us to think Ghost Recon Online may have a very bright future. We deeply encourage you to give it a try, especially if you like tactic action"
