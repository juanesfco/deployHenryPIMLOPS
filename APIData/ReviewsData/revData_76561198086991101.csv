2014-12-25,233250,False,"Was a very good game during BETA,Unless planetary weapons have been balanced, such as the planet-destroying laser, the game is lopsided.Would Not recommend unless changes are made, as initial leader in unit fabrication will most likely develop this planet laser first. As the weapon has no use limit, you are free to destroy every planet until the enemy command comes to your planet.I wish the beta was back :("
