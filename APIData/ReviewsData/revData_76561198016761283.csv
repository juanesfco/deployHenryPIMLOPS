2013-11-26,550,True,Definitely recommend for versus...but don't get the low violence version (get a friend from overseas to Gift you a copy so you) get uncut.  Also the game is getting a bit old now...really need Left 4 Dead 3 (and preferably removal of all those nasty DLR mods which have turned the game into a ridiculous parody hybrid of Left 4 Dead and Super Mario.
