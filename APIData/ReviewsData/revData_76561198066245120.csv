The CS community is smaller than other games, although it has a nice appeal that you can remember a few players who you've played with a while back, knowing whos 'hot' and whos 'not'."

All the movements are life-like and most of the players have their own styles. MyPlayer game mode will make you hooked to the game, and with the soundtrack with songs you know and love, making it even more addicting. This game is one of the best sports simulators out!"
