It became really fun after i spent a little money, this resulted in me getting better weapons and trying to improve my characters looks with hats and miscs. Over all great game!"

I personally love prop hunt, TTT and Jail break but there are heaps of other gamemodes with plenty of active player's and nice admins. Not to mention that in sandbox mode you can do whatever the hell you want. :)"
