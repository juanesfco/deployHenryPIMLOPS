Just started off, but the tutorial is kind of overwhelming, you'd probably only get the hang of the game AFTER playing the actual playthrough. So far I love it, it's been the kind of game I've been waiting for in ages. It's like Age of Empires with SimCity in one nice combination. So far, very happy."
