2016-06-18,406150,True,A relaxing and charming game that has a nice chill vibe to it. Although a bit short(About 20-30 minutes) I felt it was worth the 3.00$
2014-12-26,219150,True,i got to kill a room full of Random people with a katana 10/10
2013-10-22,440,True,Quote from heavy: PLAY DIS GAME NAOBut in all seriousness this game is amazing it has a Quality to it that just cant be beaten i now have about 1500 hours put into this game and i dont regret any of it 10/10 one of the best free to play games ever
2014-11-28,211420,True,Quite Possibly one of the Best RPG's in my Opinion Amazing Experience all round and the Combat in it is nothing short of intence 10/10 a Must Buy if you love RPG's and Chalanging Combat
2015-06-19,232090,True,So far from what i have played of Killing Floor 2 i can say that the beta is amazing and i havent found anybugs and only minor annoyences.The gun play so far is nice and polised and fun with the exception of a few balancing issues here and there but those will get ironed out eventuly and the perks all feel and play diffrently and in turn makes you feel more like a part of a bigger team overall and so far all my online experiences have been good and the comunity is nice and friendly from what i have seen.My only complaint so far is the lack of content within the game but it is still in beta so more content will be comming out eventuly. But for now i can safely say that Killing Floor 2 is an amazing so far and has a bright future
