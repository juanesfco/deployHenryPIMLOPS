Their 2006 release was quite good except it was missing a few bits. In 2008 they made the next sequel. Finnaly they finished patching it up and I hoped they would expand it a bit more but it was playable. Now we have this 'ship simulator extremes' but it's extreme failiure. Why show Ship enthusiasts one thing and then when you get it, it's not as amazing as the screenshots. It's quite under-developed. Sure the enviroment like the water looks better-ish but the same simple an basic ship simulation is in place, there is no complexity in this simulator. Some boats are missing sounds still. Worste of all VSTEP are truly control-live of this simulator, we cannot add our own mods to it, it's VSTEP or no improvement. Back in 2008 we were able to produce more realistic horns and radio chatter as well as lights. There is soo much more VSTEP could of done here but they are refusing to. If you are a True ship enthusiast, this is a blow to the head."

It's extremely disssapointing that the developers on the Second release of Mafia did not think about letting us use the public transport system, include motor-cycles, re-introduce manual gear shift a selection of melee weapons. Altho I do recomend the second release overall."
2014-09-15,24670,True,"Trainz 12 has something other up to date train sim's don't. A wide range User made add-ons which are able to provide maximum train simulation experience so you are able to personalize the train sim, MP ability, powerfull editor. The user made addons are extremely advanced, detailed and the sounds are captured well. Some may feel dis-couraged with this train sim because not all add-ons have the same quality in textures and advanced features. Due to the extreme quality of the user made add-ons some are not free but are much cheaper than Railworks's Addons, they do not feel like you're in it for the money. The Full Cab drivng mode  dose make provided a proper simulation experience as the dificulty is increased to real life. It's all down to the Content creators to put the time and effort into the routes, locomotives and rolling stock."

I encourage NASA to pass on all their ideas to the Kerbal Space Program so far so good. Hey maybe in the future we could build UFO's, it's long overdue."
