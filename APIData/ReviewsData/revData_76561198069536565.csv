2016-01-16,393380,True,Do you like talking ♥♥♥♥ with randoms while your squad leader figures out how to put down a fob.8/8 great m8 would ♥♥♥♥ talk again.But seriously great alpha get a mic and listen to the squad lead. So happy with my purchase can't wait for things to improve.
2016-09-03,496240,True,This game is the reason i bought a VIVE!!!Great game so far makes you fell like you are really in battle.A few bugs here and there but very very playable.Is a mil sim after all and not made for the casual gamer in my eyes.so if you like ♥♥♥♥ talking to your teammates and signing loudly this game is for you!Also if you didnt realise the VIVE comes with a built in mic so plz activate and use it if you decide to play this game :)
