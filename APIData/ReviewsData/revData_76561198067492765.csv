2014-10-23,241930,True,"Shadow of Mordor is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome so far. The combat is sooooo deliciously epic. Reviewers were right when they said it is a cross between the Batman Arkham games and Assassin's Creed. Executing an enemy is fantastic. The graphics are amazing and beautiful, voice-acting and sound effects are great to listen to, and so far the story is pretty strong as well.I'm so happy I decided to buy this. I'm not even a big LOTR fan, but I'm loving it."

Plus the developers have said they will improve it in the future.I know a lot of folks have said that it is ♥♥♥♥, but I think the whole point of this game is just to play something simple to cue your boredom. Something that you can switch your brain off for and just muck around (although there are serious players which I find hilarious).I know the sale won't last much longer, but for such a small amount of money.... Why the ♥♥♥♥ not?"
