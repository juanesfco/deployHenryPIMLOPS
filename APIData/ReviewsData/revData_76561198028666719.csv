2014-12-12,730,True,"I have played this game for many hours, I have had a lot of fun doing so. I'm new too the Counter Strike games. I have played CS:S for about 60 hours. But only really played deathruns. When I first got CSGO I wasn't a big fan (Got it when they didn't have skins added in) I got back in too it because I had started playing CS:S and I wanted to move up to the next best thing. I wanted to play Deathruns and all them types of game modes in CSGO, but I saw that they had a Comp game mode. I started to play that, now I just can't stop playing this game. I love it.Positives:+All around fun game+Lot of guns with-in the game+Lot of skins to be unboxed or to buy+Awesome team based game (Comp)+Helped with my talking skills+Good game to make new friends+A very nice looking gameNegative- A lot of 12 year olds- Hard to rank up in comp- Can lose a lot of money (Real Money)-9/10 MEMES"
