2013-11-19,224600,True,This game requires strong internet connection if you're from far-far away region where Defiance's server at.I stopped playing this because of it's high ping issues..it is actually really really fun to play this but be wary of it's connection. (Last played : unkown)I even have a decent PC and can still run this game perfectly at 60-70 fps if i can remember. The launcher is a bit weird because it wants to download another 15gb back in my day. I ****ing butthurt of this game because it turned it into a ****ing F2P GAME
