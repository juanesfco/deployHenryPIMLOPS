I went up the hill only just realizing I had kept thesupplies the tutorial gives you. personally it felt like cheating to me, so I restarted, and spawned at another beach. I found a town soon after  and managed to sneak in. I crawled into a small house, found a baseball bat and a colt, and thought 'Why don't I try out the colt?'. I shot the only 2 bullets at a nearby zombie while crawling, but I didn't kill him. Needless to say he ate me. I respawned nearby a military base. I snuck in, well...more like attracted every zombie in a 5 yard radius and ran into a shed with a military veichle. I jumped in the hummer to find there was no fuel. I got back out and circled around a little bit inside the shed, managing to get the zombies frozen stuck for no real reason. 'Oh, early access' I thought to myself as I quickly took a daypack, bandages and some clothes before running off into the wilderness. after 3 minutes of being chased, I found a bridge split in two and jumped into the ocean, just survivng with 10% health. Luckily, zombies don't swim. I surfaced onto a beach, put some clothes on, bandaged myself up and took off. Later I stumbled upon a camp with what looked like a working car. I ignored the zombies surrounding it, jumped in the car to find... It was fueled! I Drove off. Up the road was the town in which I died in beforehand, and that's all I can really remember.to sum it up, possibly the best free-to-play experience I have ever had so far.10/10"

A rogue-like(or 'lite', whatever its called) with survival and platforming elements creates a new and addictive experience with lots of replayability. I highly recommend this game to any rogue-like fan, and even if you aren't, you can still have a look at it.10/10"
