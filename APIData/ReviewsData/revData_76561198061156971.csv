2016-03-11,385730,True,"-----------------------------------------------------------------------The good:Way better than 2K15Sound and music are very goodRoster feels more balancedCena no longer always kicks out at 2Graphics are fair to good, depending on specs. I run everything at max settings and it's pretty good looking.Foreign objects do as much damage as they actually should nowSupposedly multiplayer is good, but I havent tried it yet (Same thing with MyCarereer) IF you buy the DLC, you actually get a good amount of things for what you pay forTitle managment (Not new, but fun as hell with all the options you are given)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The bad:For some reason, I had to use a 360 controller for my 2nd player, as a USB keyboard did not work.If you don't have a solid state drive, you have to wait about 5 minutes for the game to startup everytime (This has been fixed with the latest patch)A lot of characters use the same animationsOdd, slow motion glitches when characters go outside the ring area (announcer table, intro lane) and this is not graphics, it does the same thing on low settings for me (Fixed with latest patch)Some ladder and tag team matches work, but i have crashed about a fourth of the time trying both of those (Stability for theses matches has increased greatly with the latest patch)Apparently if you use AMD this game pretty much won't run and the devs don't plan to release fixes for itAnnouncer repeat themselves OFTEN, More than 2K15 evenSound patches out when doing 4 or more characters in 1 match (This is no longer a problem, it has been patched)Crashes seemingly at random (Not often, it did twice in 2 days which is not that be IMO) when in the menus or loading screensCounters sometimes say 'Too Early' or 'Too Late' even when no button is pressed, leading me to belive the ocunter system is messed up (It works sometimes, but really feels like RNG)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------All in all, you liked 2K15 or are really into wrestling, yes, I think you would be ok with buying it now. Hopefully they patch it soon, because the game did just release and it seems like these wouldn't be hard fixes.EDIT (3/29/16): The latest patch has fixed NUMEROUS issues, making the game feel completed now. I would most certainly reccomend this game right now, as most bugs and issues have been fixed. PC users can finally say we have an actual, good wrestling game now :D"
