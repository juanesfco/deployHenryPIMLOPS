2014-12-31,730,True,10/10 would play with drunks on New Years Eve again
2015-10-10,330830,True,HO. LY. CRAP! I will never hurt a loader bot in my life ever again. I repent of all previous times that i have done so and wish to start a life anew where I am a friend to the Loader Bots. Damn best story i've heard in a long time.
2016-06-24,396260,True,Probably the most accurate portrayal of Australia I have ever witnessed
2014-09-10,214510,True,This game sent me on a feels trip :') LOTR + A more serious LEGO + Voices straight out of the movie = An incredible game. However $50 does seem like a lot for a lego game so wait until its cheeper (I got it for $5)
2014-06-28,234490,False,I would be more likely to grate my head against a grater and eat the pieces then play this again. Controls just aren't responsive enough
