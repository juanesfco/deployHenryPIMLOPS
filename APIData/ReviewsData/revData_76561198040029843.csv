It's great that it plays the same and has the same feel especially when interacting with weapons and zeds.For people who haven't played Killing Floor before, I recommend you look up gameplay of the first one and the alpha gameplay. They're pretty similar. This game isn't about leveling up and getting perks, they just allow you to play harder difficulties with a little more ease. This game is repetitive and can take a reasonable time to play."
