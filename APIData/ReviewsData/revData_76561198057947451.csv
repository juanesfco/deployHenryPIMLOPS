The Releationships you have with some of the greatest characters ever made!Also the Story, the Combat, the Exploring and of course Commander Shepard make this game well worth the price!Well worth another few playthroughs!"

That can be a huge mistake."

A Truly Great Experience, Although It Does Have A Couple Of Flaws (Some Deaths Feel Really Cheap). But That Doesn't Take Away It's Greatness. Also, The AI For The Alien Is Some Of The Best I Have Ever Seen. It's Unpredictable And Very Clever.And The Atmosphere Is So Good That It Pulls You In, And Doesn't Let Go.Truly One Of The Best Survival Horror Games I Have Ever Played."
