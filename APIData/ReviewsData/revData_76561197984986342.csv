2014-07-08,206210,True,"An extremely fun game with hints of a 'Call of Duty' play-style  and 'Team Fortress 2' wackiness. The balance of the two styles makes the game unique, giving the feel of a competitive game that doesn't take itself seriously. I recommend this game to any lovers of First Person shooters, however this game does come with it's fair share of issues.-The Matchmaking issues are present making it seem as if there aren't any players online. (As I am in Australia, I had to change my  Steam 'Download region' to US Chicago to have any hopes of playing.)-A seeming lack of dedicated servers seem present as the game, most of the time, assigns a 'Host' for the matches making gameplay very laggy at times.This aside, Gotham City Impostors is still a very solid game that needs an equally solid community to keep it alive.I still, however, recommend this game."
