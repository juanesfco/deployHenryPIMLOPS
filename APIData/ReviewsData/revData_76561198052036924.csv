2016-06-25,233450,True,"WARNING: BEWARE THIS GAME IS EXTREMELEY ADDICTIVE.I have had many nights where I would start playing this at like 5pm and the next time I look at my clock it is 1pm on a worknight. What can I say? It is fun! A great concept and there is plenty to do. So if you do get this game I suggest putting a timer on, but who knows if you will stop playing then either."
