2016-02-10,107410,True,"Played it on free weekend once, i have to say it is a wonderful game. I think that Zues hads a good potential at taking a new perspective to the Arma series throughout the years, the strategy involved Arma's first person was wonderful but now making in top down, was a very good investment. i truly enjoyed it."
