2015-10-02,250900,True,"This game right here, this is how you Remaster a game.The Original was Great, but a bit buggy and quite limitted, But Rebirth came along.Contains all of the original content from Base and WOTL Isaac, but with more items, enemies, combos, characters and challenges. With Afterbirth coming out in October, Isaac is going to get even better.Also Bouncy Blood Urine Lazers will be great42/10"

2016-09-17,452650,False,"I received this from winning a raffle with free entry, and it still wasn't worth it.Incredibly lazy worldbuilding, models and AI, Sounds are on the edge of pointless, even on high-end PC's there are generally issues and crashes which make it unplayable, whilst also having quite long load times for such a simple and barely function game. Firing a weapon is near impossible, as it requires you to only be able to use the crosshair, aiming down sights shows you the incredibly generic weapon models, and blocks your view near completely. The enemies can't kill you, and even if they could, you'd be dead instantly, as their AI is incredibly limited to waiting until you get near enough and then proceding to push through the walls to kill you. If the Dev even cared anymore, he could at least attempt to patch this game, but that in itself would be ~such~ a task.TL:DR- The Dev needs to get his ♥♥♥♥ together if he wants people to play and buy this game."
2016-08-12,409170,True,"Good Game, could use an update that adds more levels, weapons, upgrades, but pretty good for a $3 indiegala bundle.Seriously Devs, make an update that adds more, and I could see more money in it for you."
