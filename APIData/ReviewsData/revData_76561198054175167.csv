But i feel that there aren't many people playing it. this is a shame because i love this game and i really don't want it to die from lack of players. so plz, buy dis game. there are a few hackers here and there and if you have bad ping its really hard to connect to a server. but overall, this is a really fun game, it just needs more people."
