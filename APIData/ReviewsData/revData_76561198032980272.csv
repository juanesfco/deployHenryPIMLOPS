We were completely kitted out, we all had camo clothing and some good weapons.We decided we would quickly go check the supermarket in one of the towns and obtain some food items, whilst searching. a random floor zombie appeared and attacked usWe killed the zombie but one of my friends shot at it which alerted another floor zombie and it proceeded to attack us.This time with this zombie we decided to take the more stealthy approach and use of fire axes, two of us charged at the zombie axes swingingWe both missed the zombie and ended up hittinh each other, We both instantly diedWooooooooo!!!!!! DayZ standalone"
