I can shoot my cannons and stuff but my whole HUD is gone and im stuck. I've been like this, logigng on and off of the game, steam and restarting my computer but im still stuck in this limbo. I can't jon a new game because it keeps saying i have to rejoin this perpetual game thats beign going on for hours."
