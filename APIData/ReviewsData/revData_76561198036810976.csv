2015-10-15,337320,True,it's pretty go but i needs a crouch button and the weapons all have the durability of a toilet roll
2016-03-26,365590,True,Despite it being haveing no consistent amount of quest and something it feels like you need to farm for EXP which is exertermly hard I'll let you know. its story up to where i am feels solid like i really want to know this line of story  it feels really good to play with friends it sometimes hard and slow in some missions (if your a low leveled in a high level mission which i like to do)and the atmosphere and music feel just right for its area7 out of 10
2016-05-06,350080,False,why the game is awfuly terrbile and why you should not get it 1. the game's stealth mechanics are total crap2. Nazi zombies are what devs use when they have no ideas3. Very short (i finshed it in 6.3 hour and i was lost alot of the time)4. the boss (if you can call it that) is weaker then a nanny with cancer5 I rate it a decent score of 5 outta 10 because its gameplay is not too terrible but still i bit terrible to the point that i am typing this upTo sum it all up its not worth your money and you should get the other wolfenstein but just not this one because like i said it is AWFULp.s i got this for free when i pre-ordered Doom
2014-07-19,550,True,i still have the low violence version what the ♥♥♥♥!
