2015-04-21,295110,False,"So far this game has quite a few ups and downs. 1st: This game has great combat systems, great graphics and great everything! It is really a new experience each time you play.2nd: There has been a great deal of hacking/exploiting/cheating. But i am not one of those people who hates. I understand this game is only in early development. And that there is pleanty of time to fix these things and make it better!Overall. This is an outstanding game with beautiful gameplay experience.If you are looking for a good FPS with Adventure, Action and A Good Open World Map. Then this is definately the game for you!Great Game Guys! Keep up the good work and dont let those hatters stop you from making this game the game best of 2015!5 STARS!........ this is what I wrote 1 year ago, and has the game got any better? HELL NO.The game is glitchy, has 60% of the community just blatant cheaters and not to mention the new updates that have broken the game completely. would you pay $40 for a game that has barely 60%+ reviews? Because i sure as hell wouldn't.I thought this game would get better, and most games do. But to be honest, this game has only got worse. How you may ask? Look up some videos from a year ago and you will see how.-5 STARS!"
