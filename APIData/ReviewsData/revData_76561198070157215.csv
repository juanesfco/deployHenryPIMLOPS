2016-05-16,391540,True,From playing this game from start to end I have to say that this game was truly worth my time. I don't think that I will find a game that truly makes me feel the same way that Undertale did for a long time. So if you have enough money I would recommend buying it. It's worth your time and I also recommend going into the game without knowing a thing about it.
