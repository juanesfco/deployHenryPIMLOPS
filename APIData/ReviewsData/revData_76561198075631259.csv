Having everything i chopped down taken by monkeys and manure thrown at me by another monkey. Being the level headed person i am, I then proceeded to burn down the forest they inhabited including their house. Karma came full swing then when i realised i burned everything on the small island, which left me stranded until i starved.10/10 will burn again"
