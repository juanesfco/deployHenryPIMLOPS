2014-12-19,331470,True,"Great story, soundtrack, with interesting characters and the ending was fairly decent if you got on the 410, the bad ending was sudden and didn't really go anywhere. The game is free and definitely worth a shot if you're in for a good story. If you're somewhat like me you'll get a feeling of emotion at times, it's not hard, the music makes for great atmospherical value and you may even cry. It's easy to become related to a lot of the characters. I wish there was more in the way of development of those charcters and a shame the patch was asked to be removed by steam, hah. Some of the artwork seemed a little off in comparison to the value of the background artwork. The English translation is not very well done, but they are willing to improve it and it doesn't really bother me.Overall, loved the game and the story + soundtrack and definitely worth a shot to read this amazing story, I hope they make more visual novels for steam.Anyone got a link for a download of this amazing soundtrack?"
