2016-09-17,346110,False,"Scorched earth sold for $20.00 says its a super polished DLC..... PFFFFFTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!! biggest load of ♥♥♥♥ ive even read, This game is still full of bugs that havnt been adressed since release. You can easily lose over 20+ hours of work with a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing bug, Today i tamed an Argy for 9 hours only for it to fall through the map within 20 mins...... GG would not reccomend"

2016-06-29,252490,False,"Ok so i thought id do abit of a review, 950+ hours - Been playing rust since legacy so ive seen this game grow to what it is today, Ive experienced all the new and old things in rust BUT this new XP system is just game breaking! It is basically a race to see who can farm the most, so for the people not in a big clan are at a massive disadvantage(shared XP), This also means you cant come into a wipe half way through anymore! it requires many hours if not days just to aqquire anything decent! I hope the devs are reading this! We want Rust back!!"
