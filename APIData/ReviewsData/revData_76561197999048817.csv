Well if this saying rings true then DayZ is the only way to find yourself, because I can guarantee you that you will be constantly getting lost in this shitpile of an excuse for a game.   My recent colonoscopy was a more pleasent experience than this ♥♥♥♥ing abortion.    Whether it's running around in the middle of a ♥♥♥♥ing paddock or being chased by the most glitched out pathetic looking zombies in gaming history, DayZ has it all.After having finished my first and last session of the game, I have decided that the only option left is to slit my throat and bathe in the wonderous fountain of blood as I remember losing and finding myself in the abomination that was DayZ"
