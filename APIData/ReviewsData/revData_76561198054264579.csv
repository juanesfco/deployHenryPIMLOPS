2013-12-30,228300,True,"Remember Me is a great third person, parkour, fighting game. This game is bassed in the distant year of 2084 where everyone has a device called sen-sen which lets you remember everything, upload and share their memories on the net, as well as remove unhappy or unpleasant memories. But this sen-sen device also can turn people into leapers, which are memory-addicted people who have absorbed too much memories which makes their sen-sen degrade and makes them mutate into a subhuman form. Nilin's ( the character you play as ) job is to destroy sen-sen to stop the leaper plague.This game is full of plot twists, has a unique fighting style, a great sound track and a great moral to it"
