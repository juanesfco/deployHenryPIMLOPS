2013-12-29,12210,True,"Grand Theft Auto is a huge, Gta 4 is no different it has a massive modding community, fun voice acting and charcters Comedic Moments but has underlying core values the way niko protects his family at all cost. fantastic game the only con is it has some replay value with different ending but once the story is done there is nothing else to do. Great Game lots of fun 7/10"
