2014-12-18,226700,True,"Everyone complains and moans about this game, but it is fun if you play it in a fun way. Play with a group of mates over Skype/Teamspeak/Raidcall and actually get engaged into the game. It has seen alot of improvement and i haven't came across a hacker once in my 70+ hours of gameplay. The game slowly and gradually gets updates and its the funnest of the survivals i have played. Day Z has super ♥♥♥♥ed up zombies and this game has an easier way to acquire weapons, making it a more PvP based survival.To finish, great game and i recommend getting it if you have friends to play with, and don't get too attached to your loots ;)"
