2015-02-07,104900,True,"If you want to play a multiplayer survival shooter with your mates this is one of the best on offer.Just jump in not expecting much and enjoy a great laugh.  I've fought a stegosaurus with a flamethrower, jetpacked into the sky and shot a t-rex in the face with a mini gun.  I've pied pipered a horde of raptors to rocket jump doom and successfully juggled the slow mo perk of killing a t-rex with carefully timed rocket blasts!  All this happened in multiplayer with a mate laughing alongside me.  I have a Robin Hood hat, stupid purple guns and can't survive on my own above easy difficulty level even with my acquired perks, but I love it.In the words of Smash TV, 'I'd buy that for a dollar!'"
2015-08-10,58230,True,This is a clever little crate moving gem made by an independent Aussie developer.I gave it ago and it rewarded me with a lot more fun than I was expecting.I thought I'd play for an hour and it ended up bringing me fun for a couple of days.The puzzles are great and the story is brilliant.Well worth buying on sale if you like puzzle games and want to support the indie crowd.
2016-06-23,12210,False,Absolutely horrible to get running.  Be prepared to put a few hours in to get it working well.After that I made the mistake of playing this for the story. For me it was an atrocious experience.If you want to play around in a city sandbox and are willing to put the time in to get it running then it is brilliant.However I would warn you away from the base game and point you to the expansions instead.  They are much less painful and come much more highly recommended.If you want a GTA game that is pure fun in solo play then Vice City is a better choice.If you want fun multiplayer go for GTA V.
2016-06-23,357700,True,"Its a fun game.  Its exactly what you would expect of this old Super Nintendo style shooter genre.Would love greater variety of weapon pick ups, but other than that its a blast.  Being able to buy new abilities mid-action within levels is great.Currently 4 different characters to choose from with unique styles and a couple of different game modes. Rogue has you progressing through levels killing bosses and slowly becoming more powerful.  Its a good place to start as enemies won't swarm you unless within your range of vision.So you can take your time and explore. Conquest gives you an objective to destroy while giving you the option to activate turrets to help defend yourself and sending increasingly difficult waves after you.  Good strategy and experimentation is required to succeed here.Online multiplayer is also due later this year, but has seen a few delays.  However local co-op works well.Check out videos.  If its a game that appeals to you then you are sure to have a good time here.Fingers crossed that a release date for online multiplayer arrives soon to make it even better.  Thank you."
2015-12-05,3370,False,"The core gameplay is good, but there are not enough features to recommend this version of Bookworm.If you're good at Scrabble you might enjoy this as a single player warm up game.But for me I felt there was a huge lack of features.There is no option for multiplayer here.  There are only two game modes - classic and action.  These modes are essentially the same with red tiles that burn through your stack just coming faster in action mode.The 'Hall of Fame' I saw only had a few pre-installed scores and there was no online leaderboard action going on.Once I'd had a play around with all of those things there was nothing else to do, and I found myself quickly bored.If you want a single player version of Bookworm then I recommend the Bookworm Adventures series instead."
2015-02-07,241240,True,"This game saved my long distance rekationship and continues to be regularly plastered across my social networks to the annoyance of friends.  If you are kinda interested just play it.  I loved it so much I've bought at least three times to get my friends on board as well.  Its easy to do when its $3 on sale and you get two copies to give away if you buy it as a gift ;)Building your own contraptions is wonderful ludicrous fun, and the community mods and developer updates mean there is always something new to do.  This is a labor of love from an experienced developer and it shows.The three main modes are puzle (solve a puzzle), contraption (press play and see what others made), and create (where I make my musical animal themed death traps).  The community is great and always building something new thats cool so there's something for every one!The game has also been modded to heck by others if you want to get mega creative within the engine.10/10 would play Angry Birds with cats again."
2014-12-29,20500,True,"The closure of Games For Windows Live hurt me in two ways, removing my love for two of my favorite shooters.One was the loss of Section 8 Prejudice: DLC and the other was this absolute gem, Red Faction: Guerilla.However now its back with a brilliant Steam Edition looking and playing better than ever!Red Faction is an open world game where the plot tells you that you are rescuing the workers of Mars from military opression.  The truth is its a game about hammers, and sometimes electro shock weapons, but mainly hammers.The beauty of Red Faction has always been manipulating your environment.   In this game your Handheld Anti-Military Miners Edition Ruiner or 'Hammer' is the tool for the job.You spend most of your time swinging the hammer around destroying what you see fit. You will happily be reaping destruction, ruthlessly destroying all you see for salvage for that next upgrade within minutes of starting the game.  On my joy of returning to this game I immediately set about swinging my hammer around gleefully searching for that next scrap pile, accidentally destroying the gun turret fortifications of a hapless rebel on my reckless journey for materials.With the hammer you can knock down buildings and smash nearly everything that isn't the red Mars into tiny pieces.Great joy is found using it as a biazarre stealth weapon, destroying enemies with ease as you leap out from crumbling walls, or lure them underneath crumbling ruins before striking out the last support beam.The story progresses by doing missions or creating destruction to allow the rebels to take control of each district.It can be overwhelming initially for a new player, but you quickly get into the swing of it and set about playing the game the way you want with numerous vehicles, weapons and distractions.  A personal favorite distraction of mine is completing challenges where I aim to demolish a building as fast as possible.Really there's not as much to do in it as in GTA V, or Just Cause 2, but what it does do it does very well.  If you want to reshape the battlefield around you with either a mallet or hammer this is the game for you.Highly recommended!  Its a classic and is well deserving of a go.(ps: ignore my play time.  I only spent a quarter of my time online when playing this)."
