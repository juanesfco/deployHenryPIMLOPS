2016-09-07,346110,True,"My very good totally not sarcastic review of Ark: Survival Evolved.The game is great!First off the game runs amazingly, it's clearly very well optimised. [That is sarcasm for those of you too stupid to figure it out for yourself]The pacing is perfect, it's not a true survival game unless it takes a year to do anything.The Dinosaurs look great, everyone knows dinosaurs are part rock monster. It's very uniche and not just a survival game with dinosaurs thrown in to cash in on jurassic world.I also love how when you review other dinosaur games negetivly people say 'Try Ark' it's very useful cause I had never tried it before someone told me to, not at all. Overall I give the game a 9/11 it's perfect no flaws at all, and if you think otherwise then screw you."
2013-07-12,440,False,I used to love this game but since the last few updates it has become a mess... I would not recommend it in this state.
