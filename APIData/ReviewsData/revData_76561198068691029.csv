2015-05-26,232090,True,THIS GAME IS AMAZING! it Beats Killing Floor 1 by a long mile! Even though its in early access. This game has great graphics and visuals. Amazing Gameplay. Still Badass SlowMo. And more zombies. This game is flawless other than it having little weapons and getting little amounts of money. This is well worth the $309/10
