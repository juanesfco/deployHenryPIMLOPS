ONCE you use the tickets everyone runs towards the packages with guns proceeding to kill you and taking it for themselves.. Thats MY MONEY that has just been stolen away from me...... There should be someway to Safe lock it just for you, its only FAIR when its your god damn money being spent to buy the Damn things. At this point in time i would rate H1Z1 4/10 The gameplay is standard and the graphic are sub par level. The Only thing i enjoy about H1Z1 at the moment are the awesome fist fights. Overall H1Z1 Currently - 4/10"
