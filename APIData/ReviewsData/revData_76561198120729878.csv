2014-11-05,227300,True,It's a great game for sitting down and just letting a day go by. It may get boring at times but getting that new upgrade or building that new garage is always a good feeling. I would recomend this game for somone that has a lot of spare time or just loves simulators.

But that one time you win, You feel like a Boss but you were home and there were no friends for you to boast to. Well this game is great for everyone who just needs something to fill in time."
