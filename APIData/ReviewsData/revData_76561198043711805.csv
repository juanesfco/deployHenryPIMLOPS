2015-09-11,399790,True,"Destiny Warriors is a fantastic RPG spin-off with a uniqe take on the 'Save the world' genre so many of us love.You start as a school boy in a small town who has almost completed his ninja training, while it's hard to go into too much detail without spoiling the plot it's quite fun, as you explore more levels you can also upgrade your equipment/stats and keep your favorite items in your inventory.Overall score: ★★★★★ out of ★★★★★ stars!Story: 10/10Graphics: 9/10Gameplay/mechanics: 10/10 (Has a very nice feel to the inventory/equipment managment which I like).Combat Mechanics: 10/10 (Very well done inventory/items/stat management)Music/sound: 9/10"
