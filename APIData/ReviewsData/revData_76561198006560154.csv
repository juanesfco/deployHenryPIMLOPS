2016-07-02,262060,True,15 hours in and this game is jammin. I wanted something like FTL where I would lose the game many times before adjusting to the learning curve but so far Darkest Dungeon has proven to be much more manageable. Anyone who likes Lovecraftian lore with rogue like elements will enjoy.
