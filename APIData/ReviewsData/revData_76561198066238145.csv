But as the game goes on securaty (I don't know how to spell that) gets tougher and more chances you'll get citationsAt some stages you will have to make decisions like one where this girl gives you a note saying that someone will take her passport and will force her to work at a brothel, I helped her but some people didn't.with all the stuff you need to do the game gets stressful. But of course there has to be some flaws, some times the game encouroge you to let people in just so you can get a few credits. All the flaws aside this is still a solid game 8/10"
