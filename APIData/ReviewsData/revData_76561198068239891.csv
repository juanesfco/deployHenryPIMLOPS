2016-07-30,379720,True,This is a great comeback towards the DOOM series with hours of fun inside of it and a great comeback from the lesser liked DOOM 3. The game had so much in it that the original had.The only thing that i dissliked about the game was the ending but that is forgivable because the gameplay and easter eggs are well done and DOOM was never about story.
