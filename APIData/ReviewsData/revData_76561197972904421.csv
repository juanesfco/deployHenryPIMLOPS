2014-07-01,291480,False,"♥♥♥♥ game, no Aussie servers. Dont waste your time downloading this crap, its more fun eating a jar of pickled onions then playnig this."
2015-04-22,307780,False,"A good fighter till the bad Memory Leak problem that some how got through testing eats all your Ram then crashes the game. Who the hell ever tested this needs a smak in the head and to never test games again. Worth picking up if you can get it cheap and you are a fan of MK or fighters.**Update** After the latest patch, they fixed a few issues, but the bad memory leak is still present.**Update** Since the latest patch the bad memory leak has been fixed, the online is still hit and miss                             with lag. Other then that it runs fine, but still not worth the store asking price. Have fun :)**Update**As of now WB and NRS have decided to drop the PC verion of MKX and only work on the console version, which means there will be no Kombat Pack 2 or the GGPO netcode for PC players and no more patches. WB + NRS fix for this is for you to buy a $400 subpar par machine + online subsctiption and buy the game again if you want to play MKX with the latest updates and fixes. FU WB."
