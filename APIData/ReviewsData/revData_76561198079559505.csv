2014-01-22,224900,True,Iron sky invasions has to be one of the best space dogfight simulation games out there. The combat is always new and interesting and i really like the progression system on the different ships. I highly recommend playing it.

2014-01-22,223470,True,It's really good psychotic fun but also allows a fair bit of choice giving you the option to use your own play style. Well worth playing and you should get a lot of hours out of it.
