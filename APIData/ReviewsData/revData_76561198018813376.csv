2014-05-31,242760,True,"For $15 and the amount of potential this game has, it's worth every cent/second you put into it!Crafting is alot more fun than most others and even the inventory screen is really well made to a survival aesthetic.If you need to see it just check out Frankieonpcin1080p and his video.
