Everyone must identify who their enemy is (insurgents/terrorists and security forces/counter-terrorists), and try not to kill your teammates. With customisable weapons and limited ammo (plus custom loadouts, of-course), the dependency of conserving ammo while eliminating the enemy is critical. Also helps when one can identify the enemy & react swiftly to neutralise them without dying yourself.  For those that have had enough of the normal trend of 'Hey, look! I see everything!' type of gameplay or want a really challenging FPS game, Insurgency is epic. Oh, also has an absolutely brilliant AI & amazing graphics."
2015-06-13,232910,True,"Simple, yet can be extremely technical and challenging racing game. No need to worry about collisons with other players. You're only racing for the fastest time. You can create your own maps, upload them to the map exchange (via ManiaPlanet), and have the joy that thousands of players may have the chance to race on it. Or, you can play on one of the many hundreds of thousands of maps available on the exchange. At the time of writing this, player models are still 'buggy'. Aka, the skin you choose may not be set the next time you play or may randomise to one of the other skins that are available. It's not too bad though. Throw in a second competition to find out 'Who knows what country this is from?', etc."

However, it really isn't that great. The controls. Half of the time when a key is pressed, the game either refuses to carry out that command or take a few seconds for it to be executed. A lot of fun dealing with when trying to beat the hell out of enemies. The AI. Well.. Walk up to a railing to then follow. All of a sudden the game grabs that railing out of nowhere, and now you're dangling on the other side. And when trying to get back on the platform you were on... Nope, the game throws you off the rail into the abyss below. And that's just the smallest of them all.. It would be nice to finish this game completely, but after the game crashed at the last chapter, corrupted the save, and then demanded that I start from fresh again... Yeah. Waste of time & effort that went into a game that I have wanted to play badly since I first saw/heard of it a few years ago."
