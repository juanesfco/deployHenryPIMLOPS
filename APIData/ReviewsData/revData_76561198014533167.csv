Plus, the combat system is far more balanced, and weapons actually feel like they have a lot of punch to them.  I would easily recommend this, even if you haven't played the first Dark Souls."

Instead, I'll talk about the rest of it so far as January 2015.This game is thankfully uncomplicated in its control scheme and gameplay mechanics, and the atmosphere of it is seriously tense and dramatic - perfect for dystopia effectionadoes.  The game is quite reliant on problem solving, and many of the methods for dealing with situations have results that seem a little unorthodox - which, while fitting the theme and story very well, can leave one rather frustrated.  However, for those of us who don't want to miss out on the rest of the story because of one little puzzle, there's thankfully a number of walkthroughs out there that can help you.  Alternatively, since there isn't much that directly hinges on doing things in a set order (that I know of anyway), the tactic of brute-force use-everything-with-everything and do-everything-again-just-to-see-what-happens thing can work.The combat system is fairly decent too, and while currently lacking in variety, due to the relatively low health and shields of your character it can be rather intense.  Also, quite fortunately, there are frequent saving points before combat situations so that if you die, you won't be too far behind.All in all, I like this game and I recommend it to anybody who's got a bit of time up their sleeves and an itching for a gritty and dark puzzle game."
