2015-07-10,304050,True,"This game is fantastic. The art style, the music, the gameplay, it's all of want you want and more. While yes, the servers may not be perfect yet, the Devs are working hard to improve and perfect the servers. The Devs are listening to the community. If you take a quick look down to the negative reviews, they are active down the apologizing for their mess up. While they have implemented  micro-transactions, you do not need to buy anything. I do recommend it though, as it supports the making of future games for them. Overall, I give this game a 9.43/10"
