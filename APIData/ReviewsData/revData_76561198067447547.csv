2015-06-09,292030,True,"All and all a very good experience, though i would not give it 1010 like most reviews do, but rather closer to a solid 8.5/10 and here's why:BUGS, bugs are aplenty and it seems that the devs thought it wouldn't ruin the experience so much, but guess what? Seeing Geralt's figure disappear in his horse every time there's a cinematic moment, or seing your persona walk through a collumn mid conversation or others pass through you as if you were a ghost - feels a lot like Gothic which came out many MANY years ago.(especially irritating if you pre-ordered) This, mind you is not the most irritating of those and certainly not the most persistent - there are quests I could not finish because the NPC ignored the 'talk' function, a couple of stuck loading screens after killing a monster from a contract list, bald figures with hair and clothing rendered a few seconds after close-up, and the somewhat weird duck-and-roll technique which will get you up any mountain.As far as graphics go - It looks very good though at times one cannot but wonder if it couldn't look better.  The magical immersion that's usually captured on the screenshots - is miles away from the actual feeling of immersion, almost as if it was made to be prettier on pictures rather than video."
