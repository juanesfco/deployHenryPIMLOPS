Clearly, greed has motivated releasing an incomplete game while advertising DLC *before* it was even released. A developer with integrity would release a complete package initially. In saying this, I may at some stage purchase the game to play casually but I will likely never purchase the DLC in protest. I recommend the game but not the DLC."
