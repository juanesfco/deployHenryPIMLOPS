WTF is with the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ DLC BS going on here!? i have all the DLC bought, installed and yet the game tells me to restart the game to make them actually work...I have restarted this game like 5 ♥♥♥♥ing times now and they still don't work! I tried restarting my PC and then playing the game but still no luck ♥♥♥♥ YOU ROCK STAR!"

It is freaking amazing fun!!Grab a team of mates together on steam chat or skype and have a 'blast' using rocket propelled cars to smash an over sized soccer ball across a colourful field into your opponent's goal box and maybe blow someone up along the way in a 4 vs 4 show down! With awesome customisation of vehicle bodies and exhaust effects this game has all the razzle dazzle you could ask for with speed to match.I can safely recommend this game to people, even those like me who are not into sports games. Buckle up fasten your hats and have a blast!"
