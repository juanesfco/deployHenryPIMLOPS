2015-03-01,230410,False,"I guess WarFrame is a PVE style game that puts players through a lot of missions & alerts that are basically all the same from the lowest level ones to the very highest. There are currently 4 or 5 different types of missions which range from Exterminating enemies, to capturing wanted enemies & killing enemies to keep your oxygen levels up.WarFrames can all be obtained for FREE or by buying them for a CASH SHOP currency called Platnium. Most players find them as it isn't hard but it can be very very repetative (The whole game is very very very much so) At this time there are a range of 17 or 18 frames available to players & each one has abilities that are unique to that frame.Weapons & WarFrames can be upgraded by adding or removing mod cards that players get while doing missions (They are dropped by some of the enemies) This can give the weapon extra attributes that can make it do a few very helpful things like dealing certain types of damage. (Like Radiation damage or Viral damage etc)The level system in WarFrame is a bit different from the sort most people will have encountered in most other games in that a player gains Mastery Points only by actually using weapons & frames so they level up. Everything has a level cap of level 30 as far as Frames & weapons go & ATM the highest level available to players Mastery is level 15 or 16 (Cant remember atm sorry)WarFrame was a let down for myself as I have been playing for some time during it's development & it seems to have stalled hard. It has been turned into a grind fest with players having to basically do the same type of missions all the time from the vey lowest levels to the very highest. I wouldn't recommend the game to people I know in real life as it currently stands, & hopefully the developers will find the right track & make the game good again"
2015-06-11,301520,True,Nice game where you build your own robot from the ground up!Is even better now they have done a lot more work to how matching is done & the restrictions have brought things a long way.Easy as hell to play & 'ALWAYS FUN' for ALL AGES!
2015-02-18,317360,False,"D.A.B is another one of those FPS style shooters where there really is no point to playing other than killing each other. Although the game is easy to master it very quickly becomes boring to play as other than 2 or 3 minutes of server directed mission the only other thing to do is kill each other while basically doing a very very limited number of stunts for points.Your character is controlled by the usual Keys (W,A,S,D) & the mouse & the key binbdings can be customised.Most of the maps are not real big & most of the weapons are able to shot from one side all the way to the other. ATM there are at least 1 of the weapons in the game that are OverPowered but you are able to choose from 2 types of pistols & 3 or 4 types of rifles from M16 through to a Shotgun.There is no real way of boosting health back up once you have lost it other than dying & respawning at full health again. When killed there is basically NO drawback as everything in the game is FREE & available to ALL players ALL the time.D.A.B is not a game I would recommend to anyone that asked me though at the moment as the game is currently struggling to keep the few players it still has. (There are at least 100 characters playing the game by the Leader Board around the world) At some times of the day you will struggle to find a server with more than 6-8 players on it & just about every day you will struggle to find more than 40 or 50 in total online at any one time.The graphics for the game are not bad but they suffer from a few bugs still in some places. I would guess that just about any computer could handle this game at it's lowest settings but am not sure what the minimum system reqs are.D.A.B has inbuilt Voice communications ability & all a player really needs is their headset & they are able to talk to other players in the same game as they are. Having to put up with some of the younger people that use the Voice comms can be very frustrating though as they tend to make stupid noises & stupid voices over it. (ATM I am not sure if you are able to MUTE individual players which is maybe something they will do in the future)In summing up I really can't recommend that ANYONE take the time to download this game as it is very much dying ATM due to a FAST growing number of HACKERS that basically wreck the game for 15 minutes for everyone else by 1 shoting other players which doesn't give you a chance as most of the weapons in the game take several shots to kill another player with so you always loose to trying to face off with them.Maybe if the developers do something about the lack of in the game then the game would be a whole lot better, but with the hackers, the lack of much to do ingame & the repetitiveness I think they might have a HUGE task infront of them that they just may not be able to complete.So try it if you must but don't say I didn't warn you!"
