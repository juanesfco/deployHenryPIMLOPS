2015-08-29,201810,True,I really enjoyed this game. A simple run and gun style 3d shooter. Cheesey but enjoyable. Also the sound track is amazing
2015-06-20,219640,True,I really enjoy this game although at Lans there are always a few people who rage quit. Timing is very important as well as managing your stamina. A really fun game.
