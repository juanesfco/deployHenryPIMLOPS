2014-06-29,209160,True,Firstly this game overall has potential to be good but...The multiplayer is crap and usually there is no one even on the servers. They also take forever to load or even match you to a server. If they fixed the server issues it might be betterThe single player mode is great. The story is decent and you can play as a dog (Awesome)
2014-06-29,63380,True,Great game especially if you got it during the 48 hours when it was freeIt is good but sometimes you get stuck but you can come back later and usually finish the levelLove the cinematic brain blowing sniper hits. It really adds something to the game
2014-06-29,242920,True,"Heaps Awesome gameWell worth $20 (eventhough I got it for $9.99 on sale)Just would be nicer with a cool soundtrackMultiplayer would be cool, trading with other cities but keep war away from this game"
2014-06-29,12210,True,"Its GTA of course it is AWESOMEGreat open world explorer with guns, drugs and much more great illegal stuff you cant do in real lifeAlso cant wait for GTA V to come to PC"
2014-03-22,550,True,Great game. So many maps and content. So much funAlso the mods for this game are awesome too
2014-02-25,104900,True,If you are paying $0.99 for this game it is good. Several maps and Boss Dinos it aint too bad.But I wouldnt pay more than $5 for this game so buy it while its cheap.Still a reasonable game to play with others online. Also lots of achievements to keep you going
2014-01-16,4000,True,Great game but can sometimes take a while to download extra maps and textures to play certain servers.But it is still a great game and isnt too expensive
2013-12-27,440,True,This game is so good. The best thing is that it is FREEEEEE
