ITS AMAZING THIS GAME IS EPIC i like this game because of its simplicity in how you are a knight tring to save your fellow friends 'spiral sqaud alpha six' its a very good game for children aged 9-14 its also got fighting action so older kids don't get to bored! i rate this game....                                                                                       9/10the reason this game doesnt get 10/10 is because the game glictches up alot and the enemys get WAY to hard at certian levels so you need a friend for help but this game overall is VERY GOOD

2014-12-19,319510,True,"This game.The whole concept of the game is saving yourself from jumpscares, and thats why its so good. This game is diffrent from other games. Its a horror game but you know when the jumpscares are going to happen, (Most of the time) This is a great game if you loves stratagy, you have to keep track of the animtronics and play how to stop them. This game is great and can be great seeing other people's reactions. Great game Scott <3 10/10"
