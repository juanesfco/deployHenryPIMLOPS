The itesm that you can get and the clothes well basically the variety of things that the gameplay offers is just amazing I have really enjoyed it so far and have learnt so much from it so for me I give it a 10/10 for a early access game I think it has alot of potential"

Using the same concepts as the Super Smash Brothers series it can be a bit hard to master, but Blue Mammoth games has knocked it out of the map with this one (pun intended). with a wide range of different characters to choose from and a large variety of weapons to choose from Brawlhalla is a fun game to play with friends even through all the blood, sweat, salt and tears.My Regards Rangerada is best character pls buff and nerf thatch is too op"
