2015-05-02,219640,False,Horrible completely unplayable on mac. My mac meets the requirements but whenever i get near to another person i lag out so much so i switched to an aussie server and i had 20 ping but still lagged. Another problem is that the sound is all broken up.I wish for a refund. This game is ♥♥♥♥!!!
