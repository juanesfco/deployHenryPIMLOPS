The idea of having a live action short video related to the game is great, and while the 'found footage' concept is cliched, I had no problem with using that device in this context. Unfortunately beyond that, it is forgettable. Even in a short video, something far more interesting, audacious, novel or even creepy could have been achieved. I was rather disappointed. While it wasn't terrible, I won't be recommending the video to my friends. The game, however, I'm still keen to recruit people to play with me!"

Nevermind virtual reality, augmented reality, physics modelling, immersive gameplay, real world simulations, time travel... This is the real deal! Feels exactly like having a friend. Perfect for when you don't actually have any real friends to talk to. You can have, and lose, virtual friends, and have realistic awkward conversations, where important things are unsaid and you second-guess yourself, and try to read other people's minds, while projecting your feelings onto them. For an incredibly simple game it's almost horrific torture to replay  the experience of an uncomfortable long-distance friendship while simultaneously navigating the complexities of early adulthood."
