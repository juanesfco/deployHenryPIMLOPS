2016-08-13,447820,True,"Day of Infamy - pure awesome, game reminds me of the days of Wolfenstein Return to Castle or Enemy Territory.It's good to have a FPS that is basic and not running along walls or retro looking skins to stand out...Will be recommending this game as you really do get your bang for buck!"
2016-05-13,379720,True,its good
2016-07-15,364360,False,Don't waste your money. I bought this game when it was on sale because I knew I would get screwed over but not to this degree. Very predictable once you get past the honeymoon stage when the excitement quickly runs out....Now Beastman is $15 and blood is $2 (AUD)Game in total honestly is around $20 inc all DLC etc....
