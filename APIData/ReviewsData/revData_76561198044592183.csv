Definitely needs a lot more items, a dragon that actually fights, maybe some areas where rare monsters spawn, perhaps magic items that you can make from getting items from rare monsters. This game is early ofcourse. It feels empty at the moment, but that emptiness is just an opportunity to add so much more. Food definitely runs out a bit too quick in this. Very keen to see where this idea goes."
