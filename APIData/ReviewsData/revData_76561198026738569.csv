2014-06-21,232430,True,Amazing experience. Get it when it is cheap cause the playtime is less than 2 hours (any cod campaign).
2013-11-26,440,True,This game is good
2014-08-21,237870,False,I'd give it a year
2014-08-17,67370,False,"Absolute waste of my life. First of all (despite what it says on steam), The Darkness II has not yet been optimised for Mac computers which is an absolute let down/waste of money. Don't get me wrong, i'm sure that the game is great, but from what i've seen so far playing on a high spec mac computer, is a pile of ♥♥♥♥. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT buy this game unless you are 100% sure that you have a working PC and not a mac. I want my money back you sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s."

2013-12-31,221640,True,No matter how much you try. You will always hit the ♥♥♥♥ing corner
