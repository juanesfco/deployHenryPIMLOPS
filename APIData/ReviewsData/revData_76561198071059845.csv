Telling them about the wonderful yet delapidated undersea city called Rapture, the megalomaniacal Andrew Ryan; creator of the city, the highly addicted (injectible) drugs that give you superpowers is a joy. However it continues, as you must talk about the addicted Splicers, the Big Daddies, the Little sisters, the numerous other characters you meet on your journey who have been affected by rapture differentley, the wonderful locations that are both interesting and dangerous. Or, you can just tell this 'friend' of yours to stop asking so many questions about the game and to play it for themselves.10/10 - very good game. Now play it; Would You Kindly?"
2013-12-05,203160,True,"One of the most extraordinary games i have ever played, with a great storyline and intense action every step of the way. (Yes Half life 2 is still better). The QTE in this game are some of the best that i have seen, making the player feel like they are really a part of the action. Characters such as Lara Croft and her Breasts seem very lifelike and it really makes the player connect with lara as she is propelled in numerous dangerous situations.The game overall is a bit short, but it easy to get lost in the scenary and the number of side quests and tombs that the game throws at you.It is not a cover shooter.9.5/10"
