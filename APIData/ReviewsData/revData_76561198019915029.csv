And the style and fluidity is awesome. Much better and challenging than batman. This game shares second place as my favourite rpg along with DAI. Wit her 3 is number one.Strong lore? Check. Engaging story? Check. Good voice acting and lots of it? Check. Fluid and beautiful to be part of combat? Check. Companions and relationships? Check. Crafting and customisation? Check. Attribute points? Check. Karma system? Check. Lots of side quests, most with multiple outcomes and moral choices? Beautiful detailed environments? Check. Monsters? Check. Open world(ala DAI)? Check! This game offers a lot of entertainment. Three stances in combat, you use all of them in different circumstances. Actually smart story. Factions. Technomancy. Companions with storylines and gear. Unique weapons. Lots of skill customizations. Stealth. Seriously if you love witcher, mass effect or dragon age - buy this gem."
