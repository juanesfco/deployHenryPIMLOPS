2015-11-29,304930,False,Unturned is hard for new players to grasp and multiplayer is run from zombies and dodge bullets simulator. So overall unless you know the Cheat Codes it is just boring and cheats just make it more boring. if they tweaked the zombie health it would be much easier.Also did i mention it is pay to win?
