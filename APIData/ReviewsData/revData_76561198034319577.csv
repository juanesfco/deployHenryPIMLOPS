2013-09-11,202170,True,"so much good fun-batman arkham style combat-grapples influenced by awesome Tony Jaa style martial arts (see movie The Protector)-Just Cause style vehicles + vehicle hijacking-awesome music, featuring rustie, flylo, roots manuva, hudson mohawke that'll stay in your head for days-pretty slick graphics-and a robust storyOnly gripe: it was kinda short, and some of the missions felt a bit cut and paste"
