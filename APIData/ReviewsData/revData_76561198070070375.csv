2016-06-10,394360,True,"IS HOI4 an amazing game? EHI've been playing paradox games for about a year now, starting with like 500 hours in EU4 and then moving to CK2 and Stellaris earlier in the year, and like Stellaris, this is an amazingly promising game, but a lot of things that need to be fixed are present. Such as the annoying late game frame drops. Even on my 960, but features are fun, plays well and all that, but it does need work.To set up Germany right, you need to get like a wall sized whiteboard to draw up the perfect formulaes of division setups and how many of what type of factories are needed where. But my main issue is The allies, wanting to stomp poland is essentially impossible, because the Brits and French declare war on you, which is highly innacurate. Do i love it? ♥♥♥♥ yes.Do i recommend it? Maybe in a few months.1936/1948, would rate again if they add more time periods to it."
