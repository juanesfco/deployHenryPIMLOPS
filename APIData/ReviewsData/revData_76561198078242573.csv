2014-04-05,230410,True,I find this game to be a mix of collecting card(mods) and first person shooter (this game is third person view) coupled with rpg elements like random dungeon(missions) runs.This game is completely free to play even though it may seems to be retricting because of the limited free inventory slots. You could earn platnium(premium currency) in game by trading rare items.The only fault i find at the start is the fact that they did not let new player try out all the starter frames or even provide enough infomations about the first frame you are getting. I find it fustrusting and annoying because it is hard to farm enough for another frame and you would be stuck playing the frame you hardly love like how i find myslef regretting choosing Excalibur just because it is in the tutorial.
