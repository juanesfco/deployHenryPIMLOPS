2016-01-27,307780,False,PC version seems to be no longer supported.
2015-02-28,323470,True,The best DBZ game in a really long time. A great recovery after that pile of ♥♥♥♥ Battle of Z. If you're a DBZ fan this is a must have. The online is a bit unstable currently but you can't really complain since it just launched and there are a lot of people online. If you do get it working it is worth it. Also you can do the Ginyu force Pose. With other random players.
