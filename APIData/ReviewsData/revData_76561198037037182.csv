What can I say?It's a free to play game, with the option to buy gold for vehicles, weapons and Veteran membership to help level quicker etc. But all these can be purchased with in-game money also.I do reccommend buying the veteran membership, as it does make life a lot easier to level and unlock items.I wasn't sure how I'd find this game at first, I struggled a little bit at first with what to do right from the menu.Now after i've plugged a few hours into it, I can honestly say It's been a while since I was hooked on a game for so long.I've had a lot of fun trying out the different careers, infantry, tanker, para, pilot etc  I learnt fairly quickly that I should leave the piloting to others and keep both my feet on the ground lol.  But, I do reccommend at least giving the game a go if you've never played it before and that most the real action wont happen until level 5.I have made a short video on youtube of some gameplay + funny moments too if you'd like to watch =)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSvSB6JZovE~Ozzi"
