2014-03-19,730,True,A re-visualed upgraded game from the classic CS:Source this has to be one of the best online shooters today with the game still being the same and has that classic feel for the fans with the maps all re-imaged in 1080p for today`s standard gaming.8.5/10 :)
2014-03-16,208090,True,A very fun combat game to play as a free game on Steam this is worth having a try or getting addicted too :D and has a range of weapons also custom weapons of your choice as you progress through the game :)
2015-06-28,209160,True,"I expected a really good Call of Duty game since it was from the developers that brought us Modern Warfare 2 and the older series but this game has in everyone`s view has mixed thoughts about it, I agree that his game wasn`t really that good   specialy the multiplayer. Only thing I liked about this Call of Duty was the single player campaign, the story isn`t great but it`s alright. The quick button or move moments are really cool and just bad ♥♥♥ I will admit. The villian honestly feels like an alternitive universe Makarov. I had some fun playing this game, yes it has it`s flaws and the PC port isn`t the best as well.... Motion Blur being only turned on when you hold down the knife button and it turns off when you let go of the knife button, even though I have Motion Blur turned on in the settings, there are fixs to this game but I see the PC community dosn`t really give a rats ♥♥♥ about this game and I don`t blame them. As usual the graphics look mostly the same but on maxed out it looks quite good.Conclusion, an alright game 6/10 Would of been a 7 if the PC port was actually good."
