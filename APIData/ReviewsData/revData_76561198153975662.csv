You can make vertually anything(with some restrictions of corse(blocks only)). And if you just want to pass time this game is great too. My personal favorite robot is 'the Dragon-fly'- it has 3-4 legs, wings and tail-fins, with any gun, this light framed is the untimate aerobatic assasin. But there are many other different bits and peices to put on your robot and you could just build robots for fun, that you don't need to fight with. I recommend this game!!!! :)"
