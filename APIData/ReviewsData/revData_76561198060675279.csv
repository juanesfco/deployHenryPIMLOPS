There are many good and bad point about this game.Bad Points are the hackers and griefers. I really hate coming to my house and BAM people ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me and my house with C4 and the other bad point the ping i have good connection in every other game but rust doesnt like me for ♥♥♥♥ its good but still in work progress.Good point, so many different things happen to everyone in rust its just so fun and making something over and over doesnt make me bored of this game even though its in Alpha...People who are reading those buy this game so fun but rage quiting is gona happen alot. :D still fun game."
