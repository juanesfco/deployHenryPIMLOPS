2015-05-28,218620,True,awesome game my favorite aspect to the game is the music all of 'em are good. lots of DLC's are cool too but the only bad thing is there is a lot of updates which is bad for me cause my internet isn't that good so it takes a while but other then that its a amazing game and you should buy it ok mate?
