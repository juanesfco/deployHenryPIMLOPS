2014-09-27,233450,False,As much as i really want to love this game its to broken for me to properly enjoy it. I recommend it when the game is released or close to proper release
2015-02-27,211820,False,This game was incredible and one of my favourites before this Giraffe update came and ruined everything. I am not reccomending this game at this current stage because beign forced to use the matter manipulater every time you want to mine because pickaxes and drills last 5 seconds.Thats some b.s. Until you can mine better and faster without using a ridiculous 'repair' system and be able to get your ship up and running without playing a world for 10 years to get 20 cores i will despise one of my favourites. Also what the hell is up with not being able to start a new character with a new world? i have started multiple characters since giraffe and am always! always on the exact same world i just tried to leave behind. Overall Bring back the Koala updates and this game is highly recommended!
