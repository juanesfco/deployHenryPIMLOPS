2015-02-16,323320,True,"As the robot worker B.U.D., you must tend to a beanstalk that will ultimately grow to re-unite you with your dropship. You can ride 'n' guide its shoots (they'll try to do their own thing!) so that they penetrate these floating islands, apon which the stalk will now....feed. Ok, don't worry about that bit because this game is all about the climbing.  You climb by reaching in a direction with the left thumbstick, and left/right grip is controlled by the bumpers. As you climb you always need to be gripping with one hand, or you fall. Swing the camera with the right thumbie. Elegant and fun - you feel clumsy at first, but after a short while you're bouldering like spiderman. Control is just one of many simple systems that Grow Home uses cleverly and with character. All round good game design. Not super polished -  I had some clipping issue some times, but meh, it's just fun to play and I think will spawn more than one copy-cat."
