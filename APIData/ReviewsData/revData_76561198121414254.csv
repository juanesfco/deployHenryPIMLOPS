2016-02-15,102500,True,"Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning is perhaps one of the most underestimated games on the market. From a glance it boasts nice graphics, decent amount of content and a well-crafted combat system. However, I can assure you it’s also offers a beautiful fantasy world that has completely engrossing likeable characters with tonnes of side quest (With all DLC).  I’ll admit playing with PC controls can be somewhat challenging, however the controller settings are an utter breeze. The game has a vast range of unique weaponry and armour available, which makes every task, every hidden object, and every enemy slain feel greatly more rewarding. The only complaint I have in relation to this game, is the item limit, it can be a royal pain when you’re collecting different sets to switch between. Aside from your abilities and destinies there are various skills to upgrade:  Alchemy, blacksmithing, detect hidden, dispelling, lock picking, mercantile, persuasion, sagecraft and stealth, which are upgradable from basic to master. These enable you to interact better within quests or be worse off depending on which you focus on. Persuasion can make all the difference when getting caught out in committing an offence against the town, as can lock picking as you’d probably guess why.  With the availability of the Fate Weaver it is easy to respec at any given time to get a different experience from the game which holds ones interest for longer than a one route only game. I wouldn’t go as far as to compare Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning to Skyrim, however, it’d definitely be my next choice from it. 8/10 Incredibly solid game."

I couldn't think of a more perfect combination then Mahjong and pretty anime girls to look at. A lot of people complain that it doesn't go far enough in terms of them undressing and to those people I say you should look elsewhere for your 'entertainment.' To everyone else, have fun and get clicking~! <3"

2015-09-28,200510,True,"XCOM is a beautifully crafted game, which would definitely take the place of my favourite turn-based strategy game of all time. With second wave options being available, the replayability is truly exhilarating. Of course, as per most games, the base game on it's own isn't quite as exciting without the brilliant additions, such as mechtroopers introduced by the DLC. With all that in mind I'd recommend if you can afford it, to get the whole pack for the full XCOM experience. 10/10Keep an eye out for XCOM 2, realising in February 2016! Just in time for something interesting to do on Valentine's Day."

Whether you're a campaign lover or prefer to play random scenarios, this game has something for every kind of strategy fan. Now with 'The Age of Modding' finally upon us the possibilities are endless. 10/10 Would happily spend hundreds of more hours playing this game!"
2016-02-03,206420,True,"Although I am disappointed that AU only has access to the low violence version of this game, I shall digress. Starting off as a kick-♥♥♥ president whom runs the White House on their own terms, to completely obliterating alien scum with your weaponry or with one of your various superpowers for that matter.  It’s easy to say Saints Row IV is incredibly engaging and entertaining. There's never a dull moment! You might be left questioning Santa’s motives, other than that though it’s reasonably above board… I’m kidding of course when is anything to do with the saints above board? To spite what others have said, I’ve found it incredibly easy to navigate with mouse and keyboard for this game. If your lack of owning a controller is the only thing that is stopping you from experiencing this game, don’t let it! 10/10 Fun for the whole gang."
2016-01-31,255710,True,"Cities: Skylines experience in one word? Extraordinary.Cities: Skylines not only offers breath taking visuals, it also features captivating game play by implementing the most moddable options we've seen in a city sim to date. Without a doubt the asset editor is probably one of the most brilliant ideas included with this game. Ever play a city sim where some buildings are not to your liking, require too much space or you just don’t like the general set out of them? Not anymore, you can change absolutely everything to suit your preferences and gameplay style. Once you get taken into your citizen’s messages via chirper it is unbelievably easy to lose time whilst playing this game. I cannot tell you how much time I’ve spent re-routing traffic in order to get it working smoothly, so don’t be surprised if a quick fix for heavy traffic areas become a grand plan that takes more than the quick couple of minutes you had anticipated before starting. Cities: Skylines has completely revolutionised the whole genre of city sims. Keep in mind this is just the start of something great, I cannot wait to see what else can come of this genre after such a phenomenal milestone. 11/10"
