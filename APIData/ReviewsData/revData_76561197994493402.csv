But the DZ is a great experience, with some balancing issues that will shift the meta of the game strongly towards a build here and there.Haven't seen a hacker in 2 months (playing the DZ fairly often, rank > 82). People saying the game is full of hackers are the same guys that get rekt in CS and call hacks on everyone.  I strongly recommend this game for both the PvE and the PvP aspect."
