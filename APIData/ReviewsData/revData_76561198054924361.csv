2014-12-27,105450,True,"I've loved the Age of Empires' series since I was 12. It was my first game ever and I still remember having absolutely no idea what I was doing. Not much different now. But hey, guess who discovered the wonderful world of cheat codes?This game is a wonderfully immersive city-builder, often times requiring you to multi-task (e.g. directing your army to attack while sending some villagers to chop down some trees and then going back to oversee the battle). The gameplay is smooth and the campaigns are awesome.The con is that it opens up a little funky-looking on Windows 8.1. It appears as this tiny square on the upper left corner of my screen, gotta tweak a few settings before it will show up correctly. This is one of those games where the graphics don't matter."
