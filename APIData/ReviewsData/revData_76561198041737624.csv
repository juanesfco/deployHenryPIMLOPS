2014-01-01,248610,True,"Absolutely the best top down strategy game out there, the animations are super smooth and the equipment and weapons to use is so expansive its unbelievable. You can literally play this differently every time thanks to the mission generator so i'll be putting a lot more hours into this game. Definitely Indie game of the year 10/10."
