2013-10-25,203140,True,A great installment of the Hitman series brings 47 back to assasinate even more idiots and with more levels than i know exist XD my little brother plays alot! and the newly introduced contracts mode! the physics are better than Blood Money's but if you play on easy mode so if you want a challenge even on easy buy Blood Money instead (but Absolution is still fun XD!)
