I enjoy the feeling of being frustrated with limited inventory slots, both exosuit and starship, but knowing the answer to these problems is only a galaxy or three away.But.....I have that dreadful feeling that boredom awaits just around the corner.Repetative? Yep!The content is REALLY lacking. The 'Newness' wears thin pretty quickly, only to be repalced with that 'WTF, thats it?' type of feeling.I'd seriously hold off on this one until they add a ♥♥♥♥ ton of extra content or the Modders get busy.Save your $$$. Buy Empyrion galactic survival and with the change take the family out for a meal. You'll be happy you did!"

Potential to be great, but as it stands, without a MMO platform it's quite tedious and repetative.FPS are terrible on my machine, and from what others are saying, this rings true for the majority.Will surely revisit this one in another year."
