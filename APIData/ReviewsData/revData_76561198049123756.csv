This game continues on with the humor and chaos from the first game and even in single-player I haven't felt a death was unfair or unwarranted, even on the Hard difficulty. That said, I haven't played the hardest difficulty (Bananas) yet. That said, you will probably end up dying a lot if playing by yourself, as the enemies are tougher in this game.The only part about this game that I disliked is the fact that Steam and Ice are no longer their own elements, since the game is built on the same engine as Wizard Wars. However in my mind this is a small price to pay for a release that, so far, is no where near as riddled with bugs.While I have only unlocked a small number of them so far, the new artifacts system allows you to customise your gameplay experience. I foresee myself replaying Magicka 2 more than the first game because of this.TL;DR Magicka 2 is a great successor to an already great game. While it lacks a few things from the first game, the new additions more than make up for the losses."
