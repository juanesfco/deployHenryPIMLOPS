2016-07-01,251990,True,"Long Live the Queen uses an engine for Visual Novels, looks like Princess Maker, but plays like a roguelike.Basic summary of the plot and gameplay: Due to her mother's sudden death, Elodie needs to survive 40 weeks before she turns 15 and is crowned Queen proper. You manage her class schedules which will increase her skills in different areas, but you must also keep track of her mood which can affect how easily she learns certain skills. These skills will become vital as they are frequently checked in events throughout the game. Failing these tests can have consequences that range from not gaining certain dialogue options to instant death.That's the gist of it, but as you play you realize the events of the game look far more complex than it seems. A single decision can have implications several weeks down the line, sometimes interacting with several other factors that railroad you to your death. Adding to the complexity is that sometimes the game checks for skills that didn't seem superficially necessary to an event. And sometimes these checks are STEEP to the point where you'd pretty much need to have been planning to go for them from the start.Then again, you can save and load at nearly any point in the game. Hope you've been taking notes or have a good memory. Would recommend that you only begin using a guide after the first 5 or so deaths or if you're hunting odd achievements.There is often more than one way to skin a cat - for example, you could negotiate a compromise with an invading army to back away, or utilize an alliance to intimidate them into doing so. You're not entirely hosed for neglecting a certain skill set, but you'd better make sure whatever you've invested in is appropriately polished. And because you never have enough time to max everything out, there's a constant possibility of what happens if you resolve certain conflicts in different ways, and the challenge of managing your skills and mood such that they're up to standard when the time comes. A singe complete playthrough takes about 2 hours to accomplish, but be assured you'll spend even more time exploring other events the game has to offer.9/10. Would get shanked in a duel again due to not having enough Athletics to not get tired."
2016-05-25,367020,False,"I've tried this out when it was a demo. I was really looking forward to this, with the intrigue of a dark secret in Hideaki's past and the somewhat entertaining cast.I've played through a couple routes and although each has managed to move me overall, I feel something's a little lacking.-Auto function is wonky and I need to kick it up again every now and then.-I was promised voice acting. Where are the voices?-Pacing can be a little awkward with the sudden time skips. This is particularly visible when you engage on a route. I would've liked to at least see how Hideaki is interacting with the other characters instead of them being put on a bus. Maybe have a little more of Hideaki's narration if he actually has been pushing the others away. The story will feel a little more fulfilling that way.-Sometimes I feel the route ends too quickly, and the closure after each route's climax is a little rushed. I've been whammed by the events and while I'm still reeling suddenly it's all over.Yes, the plotlines are technically complete, but they leave something to be desired. I hear there was a patch but the last we've hard from the devs is all the way back at the end of March. I'm not getting my hopes up.This is an okay visual novel, just not the best I've read. If you want this, get it at anywhere lower than its full price."
