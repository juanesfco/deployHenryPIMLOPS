2015-08-05,310560,True,"1. It is really annoying when you finish an event and keep clicking 'Enter' to quit, and you end up starting another event. I believe most of players would take a break from playing or have some time to check the upgrades that have just been unlocked from the previous match.2. There should be a warning when purchasing cars that you can't even use for the chamipionship until 20 events later. (I kept saving up using my 60's mini to buy an M3, thinking I will be doing 80s events after getting it, then I found out you have to progress from the 60s to the era that you want to play. Come on Codemaster, just make all eras available at once, most people born in the 1980s wouldn't have much interest in those 1960 or 70s old school cars)3. Give us the option to turn off not only the main menu music, but also the ones between race loading, that music is not appealing to everyone, and to me it is annoying.4. Need a tutorial, with lessons ranging  from tunning to detailed explanation of the instruction terminologies such as 'don't cut'. This game is much more refined than it was in early access period, I now change my review to positive :)"
