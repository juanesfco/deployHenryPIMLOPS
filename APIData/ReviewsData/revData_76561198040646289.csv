2016-03-31,282560,False,Stop standing up for Atari This game was suppose to be released last year however they change it to Early Access the week it was to be released. Wait for planet coaster to be fully released or buy  their early access version. Its ALOT better graphically and gameplay wise.Edit ok the new update has improved the game a bit.. If they keep it up the game will turn around and ill thumb it up :D

2014-01-27,238750,True,If you are a fan of the old turn based RPGs from the 90s you'll really enjoy this... Theres not much hand holding so if you don't like hard games best you stick more modern RPGs on easy mode.. I'm loving this.. highly recommended
