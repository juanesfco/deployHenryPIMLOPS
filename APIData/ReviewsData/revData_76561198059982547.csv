2015-10-31,227940,True,"This is a really great game but... the tutorial could be a bit more informative and ranking up is pretty slow, but playing this for a while is great and fun! When I got my new computer to play this I see that the graphics are really good. The amount of players at certain times can impact the time people can play because people can wait for 5 minutes (More or less) and be stuck at the waiting screen. There are a few bugs here and there but its not really a big deal.9.5/10"
