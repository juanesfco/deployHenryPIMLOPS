The Technology that they use to produce stunning 3d features of a defined human face is something new. Motion of how we say things is incorprated in this game done well.L.A. Noire is set 1947 puts you in as a detective that must solve murders, illegal activites, drug lords and the Mafia (Micky Cohen is the greatest real life Mafia leader, personally I can relate political power is blessed to the few and proud). Personally this game is my Game of the freakin year of 2011 I never expected I would enjoy a game like this because of the story's setting but was wrong.Go buy this game just do it I mean Rockstar created this game for all our sakes and we must have L.A. Noire a new gaming franchise of Rockstar."

The Story itself is amazing of how LOTR started and the back story of great importance of its creator who made the rings.The one thing that stuck out from other games is the new game mechanic known as the nemesis system. It is something new, innovative and fresh. This new system will be likely the future of gaming that can adapt to this kind of game mechanic. Highly recommend this game if you love to explore, challenging combat system mechanic, a bit of politics and hierchy of Good vs Evil scenario."
