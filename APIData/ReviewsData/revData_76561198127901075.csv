2015-02-13,265630,True,Fistful of Frags is a good western FPS with a few different game modes and quite an amount of wepons. Fistful of Frags is one of those game like TF2 and CSGO that don't really get old.

I have had so much fun in the past, there are so many different game modes to play which is what I love about it. Getting on the game every now-and-than and screwing around with your friends building the most stupid things."
2015-02-09,203160,True,"Tomb Raider is probably the best game I have ever played. It has the most amount of emotion and the graphics are phenomenol; I got stuck into the story so much, the combat is pretty amazing and I loved the parkour. Kinda disappointed that they abandoned the Multi-Player. Definitely would recommend this game."
