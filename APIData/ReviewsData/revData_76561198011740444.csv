2016-03-12,255710,True,"Cities: Skylines hit the sweet spot of city building with a great mix of economic sim, traffic manager and overall great simulator.If you are a fan of city builders there is no reason not to pick the game up right now, as it's very likely that you'll enjoy the game as many other fans have. Colossal Order and Paradox keep supporting the game with both payed DLC's and free updateds with bug fixes and improvements. "
