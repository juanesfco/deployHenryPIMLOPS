2015-03-23,319630,True,"this is a beautifuly designed game which seems to build on and even supass that basic framework of the TelTale games.aside from the differant graphics style, what sets this game apart is the characters interaction with the world, less point and click, more second person RPG. thi sis a destinct advantage in my opinion over the much loved teltale game series'.beautifuly designed, great 3D movement, great story :D :D :D"
