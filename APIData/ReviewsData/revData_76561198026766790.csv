If this sounds cool to you then get it, if you want something more don't buy it then complain about how its not what you wanted, and please read the description."
2014-01-09,6020,True,"Pretty much if you're a Star Wars fan that wants a game that enables you to customize and upgrade your character, explore lots of worlds and slice, shoot, blow-up, stab, and electricute your enemies but, one that dosen't have all this nonsense like in Star Wars Knights of the old republic (which is still a great game)  EG. no jumping, stupid point and click combat system etc. then this is the game for you. Also if you like this game then get Star Wars Jedi Knight II Outcast, it pretty much has the same look, feel to it as this one only no customizing. also you don't need a good computer to run this game it was made in like 2003. GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)-"
2014-03-26,204450,True,"This is overall one of the better western games I have played and has a good upgrading system, great physics, somewhat destroyable environment and good firefighting. BUT, the one thing I didn't like about this game was the guns, the guns in this game are EXCELLENT to use and high detail but as the game moves foward in time, I felt like I was missing out on all the new weaponary of the time, like in the year 1910 for example people still used all the old guns in real life but there were tons of new ones peope used as well and I have listed some that should have been there or can maybe be there for the next game(you should look them up):Bolt Action Rifes:-M1903 Springfield from 1900 onwards (not realistic but almost all the guns are anachronistic)-M1892 Krag Jorgensen Rifle from 1890 onwardsSemi Automatic Pistols-Mauser C96 from 1895 onwards (not realistic but almost all the guns are anachronistic, besides the gun 1896 one year later)-Colt M1900/M1902 from 1900 (1902 model is almost identical)Double Action Revolvers-Colt M1877 from 1877 onwards besides John Wesley Hardin used this gun-Colt 1892 .38 RevolverYeah thats it I give this game 8.9/10 if the next game gets these guns and mabye a bit of open worldish feel like the older ones then ill give it 12/10"
