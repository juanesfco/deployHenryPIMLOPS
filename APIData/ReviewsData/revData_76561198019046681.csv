Its not as polished to FM standards yet. But if the developers listen to Rugby gamers, it will surely improve with patches..Don't allow these negative comments stop you buying this game. You won't regret getiing a dud.I'd recommend this game to any serious Rugby fan."

2014-12-27,216260,False,"WARNING:You need a permanent connection online to play this game. There are also problems when connecting, even when your firewall is disabled. The developers say its a piracy issue but people without a permanent online connection will be tempted to download the pirated version to play single player mode. So read the fine print before purchasing this game.The game is superb when getting it to play though. Its very realistic with many user options and features."
