2014-06-08,730,True,"At first when I played this game I had an immediate flurry of thoughts relating the game to Call of Duty 6, but soon as I grew into and adapted to the games mechanics, I found myself appreciating the game a lot more as there have been glorious updates and reworks to maps I used to play in Cs: Source. Fun game, addictive, reward systems are good, buy/trade market is appropriate and overall solid game. Definantly worth a buy."
