It is a very balanced skill based game, with the wise choice of a cosmetic-only based DLC model. Every time a DLC for this game comes out, I'll straight up buy it, regardless of the content purely because I feel Psyonix needs more of my money for such a brilliant brilliant game.Sidenote: Play this with a controller, trust me."
2016-03-12,422970,True,"Honestly before I bought this game I doubted it was worth $5. But after diving headfirst into what I could call one of the hardest games ever, it completely exceeded my expectations. Basically everything about the game is perfect. From the tight controls to the nostalgic graphical style to the near-perfect sound design, I LOVE THIS GAME"
