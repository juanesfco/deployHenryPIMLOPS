This game through co-op is what makes this game along with it's innovative fight & weapon system. With firearms scarce, it's an adrenaline rush having to go toe-to-toe with the enemies making sure Rambo-ing isn't the necessary way to fight. All in all, get this game and beat the living ♥♥♥♥ out of those mother♥♥♥♥in' zombies!"

Although not on a Grand Strategy scale like EU or HoI whom needs plenty of attention to manage your Empire, Sengoku even though a specific strategy game based on 16th Japan - requires on-the-fly managing to ensure you're clan doesn't wipe out, provinces are safe and relations are intact etc. This fast paced game is harsh on those not aware overall on what their clan is up to so make sure you learn how to play!"

Said to be Paradox's hardest grand strategy game, Victoria 2 can be unwelcoming to the newest of players but once you get the ball rolling, it can make to be a fun & challenging game."

Whilst easier to play than HoI3, EU3 still is a grand strategy game that will require alot of micromanaging + thinking to ensure you are getting the best out of you country. A game not for made for impatient or light RTS gamers."
