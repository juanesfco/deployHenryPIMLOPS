2016-08-29,275850,False,"I tried to give this game a chance. I had to look past the missing features, terrible fps and general negativity. The game was overhyped, I was excited at the fact that I could travel through space and visit 'almost infinite worlds' but honestly it was just mine, mine, fuel up your ship and life support so you don't die and mine again. I've learnt my lesson, never get overhyped or preorder games. I would not recommend this game if you expect to do a lot but if you're fine with exploring the same planets and mining, go ahead."
