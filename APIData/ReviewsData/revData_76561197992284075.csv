No sleep. No free lives. That score. So close. Only rage.Just buy it.:D
2015-04-26,72850,True,Rated 25% -  Because that's how much the Mod creators get. Unethical at best.Update 28th - Steam/Bethesda rescinds paid workshop.
2014-12-14,257510,True,"Absoloutely Incredible. Mark my words; Best game of the year.Love puzzles? Simply put. You need this game!The graphics are stunning, the music is mesmerising, and to top it off, I can still play with a decent framerate on my toaster. I've always been the type to skip past the story crap in games. But I strangely found myself reading everything, questioning everything, thinking about everything and wholy engaging in the story. Even if you still don't get hooked on the story, the gameplay alone is worth every minute. The puzzles will make you twitch with delight or want to kill something beautiful but the non-linear gameplay means you can skip anything and return without having to 'endure' a tough spot.Not convinced? Play the public test. That's how I got hooked. Now please excuse me while I replay the game. :]"
