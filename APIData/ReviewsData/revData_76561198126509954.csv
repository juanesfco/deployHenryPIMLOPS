2014-06-30,265930,True,"I paid 6 dollars for a game that lags more than a snail weighed down by a truck. Not even turning off the dynamic settings does anything. Not happy.EDITOk, so my last reviews for this game was negative, but now that I've made it playable, I'm quite happy with it."
2014-06-02,265630,True,"Fistful of Frags, where to begin? First off, you can be a cowboy. Second, you can drink whiskey. Lastly, you can Spartan kick people in the gonads. This game is basicly Half Life 2 Deathmatch, only set in the wild west. If thats not cool, I don't know what is."
