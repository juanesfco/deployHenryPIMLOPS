2016-06-28,381210,False,"POSITIVESGreat Game! Really fun and there is a lot to do in the game that makes you want to continue to play. There are unlockables like Perks, Offerings, Clothes, Items, Addons etc. You can level up your characters as well as your rank for both Survivor and Killer.You can also play private matches with your friends and you won't lose anything if you do die as a survivor.The ranking system in my opinion is good enough for now; you collect these crystals (at least they look like crystals) called PIPS, according to the official Dead By Daylight Manual, and when you collect a certain amount in a row,  you get promoted. The lowest rank in the game is 20 and the highest rank is 1. To get from rank 20-19 you must collect 3 pips. From Rank 12 and onwards, you must collect 5 pips each rank down, meaning Rank 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 require 5 pips each before you get to Rank 1 for both Survivor and Killer.So the game seems cool, right? Well, most games aren't that perfect...TLDR: Great Game, Fun, Lost of Unlockables, makes you want to continue playing, Private Matches, Ranking System, Collect Pips to Rank Up, Rank 20 lowest rank, Rank 1 Highest Rank.NEGATIVESThe only way to rank up in the game is to play public matches, and this makes it difficult because people try and find their friends so they search and quit lobbies until they find them because you currently CANNOT invite your friends to public matches, only private matches, and some players just boost each other. For example one person plays as the killer, hosting the lobby and the other playing as a survivor, and they troll you. There are many disadvantages in the game too, such as:- The host of every game is the killer. This is bad because almost every killer in the game has a ♥♥♥♥ ISP.- Everybody is searching for their friends, and sometimes it can take a while to find a game. The longest it took me to once find a game was 1 hour for this reason...- You will lag in almost EVERY game.- You WILL rage.- You WILL die in stupid ways.- You WILL get stuck in objects.- There are HACKERS in this game too!Now it's time to elaborate on these points. The killer being the host of every game really annoys me, just because it gives them a huge advantage. Think of it like this; The host controls everything, and you and your friends are normal people doing normal stuff. But the host has ♥♥♥♥ internet, and because he controls everything, it affects you and your friends WAY more than it does for him. As a matter of fact, it doesn't affect him at all. LAG will ruin you, and make you rage. I've lost many games just because of lag. But how does the lag affect you in game? Well, when you attempt to vault over something, like a wall or object, and you're lagging, you are going to die, especially if the killer's chasing you, because what happens is that rather than vaulting, your character FREEZES. Lag also makes you teleport literally everywhere and will get you killed. This is why you will rage and die in the most stupidest ways.You will also get stuck in objects. One time I spawned into a game (The developers call these TRIALS) and I was repairing a generator. Then the killer was coming towards me and I was thinking, 'Oh no problem, I will just hide behind this tree.' So I go behind 'This tree' and crouch and he walks past me. 'Yeh I'm all good.' I think to myself. Then I go to walk away from the tree and then just like that, I was stuck. I literally couldn't move, and the murderer was coming back. He walked past me again and didn't see me. Although he didn't see me, I was still very angry, because I wasn't going to be able to survive unless I get him to kill me. So I just quit and also got demoted and lost my item. This is why the Killer has such a HUGE advantage in the game. This also isn't the only object I've gotten stuck into.I have recorded games I've played where my connection with the Killer was very bad, and I will perhaps upload them soon to my Steam profile/YouTube channel (Link on Profile!). So be sure to check those out if you would like to see more on what I'm talking about.Last but not least, hackers, yes, there are hackers already... And the game was only recently released, EVEN with an ANTI-CHEAT! This just really confuses me as to why their anti-cheat software hasn't even banned these players yet. I saw a player who had prestiged his Claudette Morel to level 1000, which at this stage, is an impossible stage to even be on. Most players, almost all, haven't even prestiged, including myself. TLDR: Game has more negatives than positives. ConclusionSo to conclude my review, this game needs more development. The game is great and fun, but when you take the negatives into account, Dead By Daylight isn't really the best game to buy at this time. I believe the developers didn't give enough time on their project and should have continued developing the game and released it at a later date. But the developers are still working on patches and have apparently said they wil be allowing people to invite their friends to public games instead of just private games. So to say they should be adding more patches as well. But in the meantime, I recommend you should save your money for the time being and wait till more patches come through.Thank you for reading my review!"
2015-12-07,252490,False,"Very Annoying. Made a very cool base in a cave. locked the front door with a lock and key. Ventured out to find loot. I fell and died. Fair enough. So I respawn back at my base, cause I thought I could create another key for my door, but I obviously couldn't so I couldn't get out. So I suicided by typing kill in the console. Spawned close outside of my base and ran to where I died and my loot was gone, including my key. So I couldn't get in or out of my base and everything I did was a waste of time. I'll have to bust my front door open which can take me a while and because I can't leave my base I can't go to get resources if one of my items break. *sigh*"
