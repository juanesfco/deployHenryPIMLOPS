2015-02-28,297810,False,"I used to love this game. When I bought it before the combat update, I thought 'Finally a sandbox game without combat. I can build and craft to my hearts content.'I haven't played it in a while and decided to see how the game mechanics were. I created a new character, knowing that I would spawn on a tier 1 world. Within five minutes of exploring and harvesting materials, I was killed by a monster that dealt 700 damage with each attack! I was near the Spire at the time, which I assumed would have weaker monsters surrounding it.Then I had a look at what I would need for a new weapon and some armour, but I found out that the only way to craft weapons and armour was with a material that only monsters drop.I then went in search of a weaker monster, and finally found a wisp, killed it and received only one of the material. Keep in mind that you need a minimum of 1000 of them.This is not a game I would reccommend to others with the new combat update.Game Developers,,,,,You disappoint me"
