2016-07-24,319630,True,"After getting the first episode of Life is Strange I didn't know what to expect. After finishing the first episode I wanted to play the other episodes and see how it ends. This game does have the Walking Dead dialogue feel, but I mainly enjoyed the Story itself, the Art style the game offered and I do commend the Graphics and the Music, but I will mainly commend the Story and Characters. You will not regret buying this game, it is nice and once you finish the first season of this game you will feel like wanting a second season. I cannot wait for a second game to play9/10"
