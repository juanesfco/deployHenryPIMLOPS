But otherwise I think this game will be perfect once the Through the Ages DLC comes out."
2016-05-28,318600,True,If you were left feeling a little let down after Dont Starve's meh Shipwrecked DLC then you will be overjoyed by The Flame in the Flood. I think It's basically what Klei wanted to do with Shipwreked but coudn't. The Nomadic survival gameplay that they tried to push with the new characters is exactly what this game nails as you are forced to progress in order to survive.
