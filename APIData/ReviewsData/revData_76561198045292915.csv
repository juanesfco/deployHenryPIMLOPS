I thought I experienced top-of-the-line gaming when I played amazing games such as Farming Simulator, but I've been bested. With an emotional story line, Bad Rats allows you to play with amazing features such as archery, realistic physics and perfect video settings. I often get sucked into the amazing gameplay. It's an enthralling game which needs to be given more love. With realistic and heart-wrenching character development, you truly begin to understand life as one of the 'Bad Rats'."
