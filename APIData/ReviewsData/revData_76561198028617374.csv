2016-01-03,368720,False,"Not a very good game for a space mmo with ALOT of flaws but i see potential in this game if updates are being pulled out constantly.Problems with the game- Its Boring, pretty much only 2 things to do and that is mine random asteroids for ores and fight the same enemies over and over again. It has a quest system but can't access it (due to UI being buggy), if they fix the questing system and add alittle more enemies so that its not repetitive the game play will be alot better.-UI is buggy as hell, I would open a menu up only to find it empty. Another problem i found is when i open the inventory i have it half way through the tabs and nothing show up as well. If you fix this and make tabs like the inventory and character profile page floating so you can move it across the screen it would help alot there are more problems but this is just a few to start off with."
