The combat is definetly highlight to this game, was the only reason why i put so many hours into it.The rest of the game mechanics are pretty average.If you are after a casual RPG that isn't very difficult and is quite basic then check this out. Don't bother with the DLC though especially the Weapon and Armor Bundle...."
