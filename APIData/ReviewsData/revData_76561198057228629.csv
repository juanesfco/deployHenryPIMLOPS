2015-08-06,289130,True,"The moment you go Drakken and try to win a diplomatic victory and the necrophages are in the game. playing again friend nearly always do manual unless u know u will win or lose because game is a little weird with pvp battles. when u go playing broken lords buying ♥♥♥♥ tons of crap of market and roving clans ban u from it even though they are earning gold from you buying stuff *WHAT! O.o* also very likely to run into the same team you are playing are in singleplayer and most of the time it'll hate you *of course hate it's self?* game is weird, funny, a little buggy (of course still fairly new game), but all up fun even in single player unlike other 4x stratergy games which get boring in single player quickly. recommend buying it but like all game not perfect but still get it if u like 4x stratergies, and fantasy (but can be a bit anoying when a quest tells u to declare war on an ally T_T luckly ai in this can be forgiving)"
2014-10-04,8930,True,When you play your first game ever declare war on Gandhi and he's allied every city-state and they surround him :| really. Awesome game multiplay could use a LOT of work single player fun but ai in it r ♥♥♥♥ing stupid so pretty easy to beat them only real fun your gonna get is in multiplayer but then again really buggy but heeps of fun get the DLC's and some mods then it becomes really fun. *Btw go egypt first time so broken.
