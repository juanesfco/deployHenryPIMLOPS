2015-01-09,33230,True,"Assassin's Creed II is the follow-up to Ubisoft's 2007 hit that attracted a mass audience if not unanimous critical acclaim. The sequel is an expansive and bloody romp through Renaissance Italy that plays up every popular aspect of the first installment while righting many of its flaws.It is set in italy, as an assassin you want to kill the people you killed your family.this game has above average graphics, nice open world, and better yet, horses.8/10"
