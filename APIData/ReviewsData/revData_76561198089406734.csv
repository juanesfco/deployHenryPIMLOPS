2013-12-17,252490,True,It is a nice survival based game. You may have to build houses over and over again but you will eventually get a well protected house to put all your loot inside. Great and enjoyable game to play with your mates.

2015-07-06,730,True,A old but great game to develop team building skills with your friends. Sure can take your money away with trying to get good skins out of crates though. Spent a good $50 bucks within my first 20 hours of playing the game. May take your money but still a great game.
