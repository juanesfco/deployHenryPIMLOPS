It's well worth a try! :)Robocraft is in early release. But even so, there is a great amount of work that has gone into the game play and construction side of it. Apart from the rare dropping through a map element, everthing seems firm, and real.The Beginnings...The premise is simple. You need to use 'cubes' to build a 'vehicle' (or 'robo'), stick one of three types of weapons on, in or under it.. and then the fun begins!BattleSo far, it's cap the point. (I've seen requests for Death Match though.) You get teleported into a map which has your base (Blue) at one end, and Red's base at the other end. The map is set on other planets. What I have seen to date basically consists of barren wastelands. Dirt or Snow/Ice etc. The maps are well crafted and they allow for plenty of natural cover.As the aim is to either remove your opposition, or cap the point, you have a variety of options in your bot builds - depending on how you feel & how you play.CubesThe Cubes range from everything from low weight / low armour cubes, to armoured helium filled cubes, to aerofoils, to hover blades, to radar, and of course - weapons.WeaponsYou have three choices at the present time. SMGs. ie: 'Lasers', Plasma launchers, and Railguns.Each of these have different play styles to make them work, and each of them have their own weaknesses. (For example, Railguns have a huge recharge time, while SMGs have a short one. (putting plasmas in the middle)Upgrades and Tech researchWhat I found confusing at first was the Tier system for bots. When you build a bot, the quantity and the type of cubes that you incorporate give your robo a rating, or a tier placing. Based on that, you will fight simillarly tiered foe. You need to research your tech to allow for higher rated cubes. And for that, you get a set of points (the name of which escapes me at the moment). Further to this, you also get Repair Points (RP) to allow you to purchase new cubes to then fit on your craft.(It's a lot to take in and process / reconcile here, but it makes contextual sense in the game after a while.)Your RobosYou have the option of making anything you want. Any shape you want. As many weapons as you want. As fast / slow as you want... Provided it's either on wheels, hovers a few (game relative) meters above the ground, or flys.There are lots of crazy and awe inspiring designs around.Final WordsI really like this game, it's bumped out my mainstay game-of-choice to basically non-existance since I downloaded it. So, I give this 8.5 of 10 cubes."
2016-05-04,407840,True,"The Review: PreludeMy friend Jacko has reminded me that this game is early access, and cost me a whopping 99 cents AuD.The ReviewIf you have read my review of this game in the last few days, it was a do not recommend, with some frustration strewn throughout. However, I have now replayed it with controls set up in a way that actually works. Now this review is happily a recommend :) although, there is a way to go, the bulk of the game is there, and appears to be solid enough. Oh, and may I also recommend that you start playing as an Assult class. It is a simple class, and one that gets you a feel for the game nicely.The backgroundI played Orion: Prelude, and when this came out - BAM insta-buy. I finally get around to trying it, and it's no longer First Person view. :( This may not be a deal breaker for you, but that's what I love playing. (I've been informed below that in version 1.5, FPV is back!)The GameThere are two modes of view. Top down third person, and over the shoulder third person. (And the v1.5 First Person)Things I like:Looks quite nice. (GTX 750 Ti)The harvester has a sense of humour! :DThere appears to be a lot of work gone into the tech/upgrade tree. Hopefully this will allow for diverse / specialised set ups for people.Now that I have proceeded past the initial shock of the change of view. I can see why Jacko (again) said that he really enjoyed his first play, and made friends. He's pretty easy to get along with when you first meet - so that's a good sign. :) I'm yet to delve into the online version of this, as my time was short.Things I don't like:The jump binding is conveniently called 'Roll'. (dual purpose - In actual fact, the whole control system seems to very geared towards handheld controllers.)The game takes a while to load, but shows no indication that it is indeed loading. In fact, it doesn't even show up on the taskbar - making me think, each time, that it's frozen. (Intel Core i5-4690 2.5GHz / 16GB RAM / Win 10)The character that is 'you' seems disconnected from the world. That is to say, that the world could be projected onto a wall, and 'you' just dance around in front of it. (For over the shoulder view)The action of the grenade throw, and the actual grenade movement is lame. Needs work. ('early access')Certain characters (ie: Assault) insist upon saying 'look at me go' every time you use the jetpack. Not a major gripe, but I hope in the final release it gives that a break from 100% of the time.Discoveries:F1 Key switches between views. (Thanks Jacko)Despite you view not being First Person (out of the visor), the world around you seems to move with your characters breathing. And as I wrote above, and you'll read in the comments, in version 1.5, true first person view will be back.I can't tell if it's my underspec'd character, or that the jump / boost ceiling is very low. But getting around up high is very hard.If you do manage to get up above the ground, only the dino flyers even attempt to get you. Most ground dinos become confused, and don't necessarily even attempt their primary destructive objective.There are Hats - TF2, oh how you've changed the world.There are drops and chests to be found.Dem FeelsMy initial feelings about this game was that I didn't get it. I got the Prelude, but this one... Now that I have rejiggerd the controls, and played it again on a simpler class - I had more of an affinity for it. So I'm happier now.The End BitI'm sure more things will come to light as I play this in multiplayer mode. And I'm glad I gave this game another chance. I look forward to seeing where the devs take this.Thanks to Jacko, Neomeinx and Cjnfl for helping me with this review."
