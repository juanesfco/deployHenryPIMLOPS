2013-12-06,51100,False,"This game could have earned more respect and gained my talent if it werent for all the having rent and paying this the only way to get stuff forever! Ingame credits is so hard to get. The playermodels suck balls, the phyics are terrible. Community dieing. Id rather go play the first counter strike game then this. Pros:Good featuresBetter then COD GhostsBetter then WarZ/Infesation Survivor StoriesNice Items in the storeFun to laugh and get competitive aboutCons:Bad Physics Terrible PlayermodelsSometimes it can be a PAY 2 WIN!Not work being put into this gamePeople that can pay dominate easy peesy"
