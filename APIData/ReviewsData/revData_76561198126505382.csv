This game is amazing, with a decent campaing storyline and in-depth features, including the need to keep your troops warm, and soldiers health. Paying ingame is optional, and can give an unfair advantage over those who don't wish to spend more, but you can still get perks without paying. Commanders play an essential role in the game, giving special buffs and units, such as.... TIGERS!!!! ELEPHANTS!!!! IS-2!!!!! KV-2!!!! Generally, the later perks cost more, but are more effective. You get these better perks by earning EXP and killing enemy units and capturing points. On the subject of points, these are where you get your resources from. To capture a point, you have to send a unit inside a certain area. In certain gamemodes, to win you must capture 'Victory points', which take points from the enemy, resulting in their eventual demise. Another gamemode, Annihlation, you must destroy the enemy headquaters. To sum it up, your a commander during WW2, and you must use the supplies available to you to kick your enemy's ♥♥♥ back to Berlin/Moscow/Washington. Get it!"
