You find yourself caring more and more about the people you discover in the story and empathising with their joys and disappointments as if you knew them intimately. The game does a brilliant job of putting you in your character's shoes and developing each character that's represented at a pace that feels natural and unhurried. I'm sure a story that is shockingly real to many people, which makes it so so easy to relate to.Probably not for those who don't enjoy 'interactive stories.'"
