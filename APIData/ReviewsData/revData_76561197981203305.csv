2016-01-03,410210,False,No options. No explanation. Average gameplay. Not worth the time.
2015-11-15,336380,False,"The interface and controls of this game put me off entirely.You can't customize the controls and the defaults have the camera controled by the keyboard and movement controlled by the mouse, which is completely opposite to the way that I find comfortable.People keep telling you to go to places, like they expect you know the area, but having just started the game and there not being a minimap or anything to give you directions, that became really annoying really quickly."
2013-12-20,222480,False,Big let down.Can't play the campaign with people. (Co-op is in Raid Mode)Bad controls.Bad acting.Encounters that just don't feel like a resident evil game.
2014-08-01,219890,True,Great puzzler.Lots of mind twists and interesting life lessons.Well worth playing.
