2014-09-29,282440,True,"I remember when I first joined 'Quake Live' it was not on Steam, It was in Beta but was just as good as all it's previous games. I definately would like to see either a Co-Op campaign added or an ability to create non pro servers for non pro members. In my opinion this game deserves a 9/10."
