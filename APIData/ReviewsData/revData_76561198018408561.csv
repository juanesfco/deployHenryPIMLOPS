The gunplay is unsastisfying and awkward, with many of the iron-sights on the weapons bordering on useless.The plot of the game is moronic, racist and disrespectful to the ongoing human tragedy that is the Mexican Drug War. In particular I felt uncomfortable mercilessly killing hundreds of 'gang members' when I was supposed to be playing a police officer. No policing or investigating is done in this game at all. Its plot and mechanics are totally at odds.If you have any respect for yourself or your money do not play this game. Take your money elsewhere."
