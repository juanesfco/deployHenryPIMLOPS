2016-05-29,241540,True,Closest thing to a proper Walking Dead game that there is. Only thing I want is a co-op mode.Dev kinda did the dirty though by releasing the game again at a greater cost for a slight remaster. Some won't mind but I don't exactly enjoy this practise unless its for a real meaning.
2016-05-29,239820,True,Fantastic game. Please support the devs to this game so you can become a dev and ask people to support you ^.^
2015-02-09,72850,True,Im more of a fallout & oblivion kind of guy but replaying this with 100+ mods is damn fun!Pick it up if you got the time and money if you dont have it already.
2015-02-09,268050,True,Dont understand all the hate surrounding this game.Was a very intense and almost sadistic survival horror game.9/10
2014-12-20,41070,False,I loved the 2nd Serious Sam but this really didnt do it for me.
2014-07-09,200510,True,Best Stratedgy Game Ever!9/10
2014-07-09,201810,True,"Wolfenstein: The New Order is the greatest FPS I have played EVER.The Fluidity of the controls (I use a PS3 controller) makes its a joy to play and the characters really feel alive, which is no easy feat.The only possible negatives would be no multiplayer (Depending on perspective, I didnt mind because I bought it for the SP) and the feeling that sometimes the story was bit dumbed down and far-fetched.I loved it, loved it some more, then finished it twice 9.5/10 :D"
