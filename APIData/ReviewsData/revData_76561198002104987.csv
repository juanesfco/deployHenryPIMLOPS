2014-07-12,250320,True,"Another master piece from Telltale Games. I purchased Wolf Among Us because I loved the first season of The Walking Dead (TWD) by Telltale Games and somehow, Telltale have managed to surpass what they portrayed so perfectly in TWD. The story, characters, art style, soundtrack, decisions and gameplay mechanics are all vastly improved in Wolf Among Us. The story of The Wolf Among Us reolves around the character known as Bigby who is the detective of Fabletown and is the Big Bad Wolf Fable character. Bigby is on the case to solve the mystery of a certain Fable's death (Spoilers). This leads you to meet a ton of fascinating Fable characters in Fabletown like Snow White, Woodsman, Toad, etc. Every single Fable character you run into is fascinating to listen to and Telltale go the extra mile by having a character profile for every Fable character if you're interested in the lore of the universe. The art style is gorgeous, it has this handdrawn vibrant noir style that looks beautiful in all scenarios, especially outside Fabletown in the colorful areas. The soundtrack suits the games themes of mystery, hopelessness and noir perfectly, there's a soundtrack for every moment, whether it's action, detective scenarios or depression, Bigby's Apartment theme is a favourite of mine. Considering this is a Telltale game, it's still a point and click adventure game just like all their games and the gameplay isn't exactly what you would call, 'fun', but it's not supposed to be, it's supposed to be a game that makes you think, question your morality, your choices, who you trust, what you say, where to go, etc. Every decision you make affects the outcome of the story, the characters you meet and the detective case at hand and that's what makes the game so enjoyable to play. Without a doubt, Wolf Among Us is one of my favourite games of all time, Telltale have done it again and I can't recommend this game enough, especially with all 5 episodes now released, it's a must buy.10/10"
2014-06-28,107100,True,"Bastion is easily one of the best Indepdent games ever made and is one of my favourite games of all time. Bastion is an Action RPG with a beautiful hand drawn art style, fascinating lore, a narrator that is engaging as the Halo Multiplayer announcer and some of the most compelling and rewarding combat. It will take you around 6 - 8 hours to complete the main campaign but there are side activites you can complete to level up your character, weapons and to buy items like Vigils, Spirits and Abilities at the store and more. The only negative of Bastion for me was that the story was confusing to understand and follow at times, but it is still an engaging narrative and is told beautifully by the 'Old man' narrator. Super Giant Games have created a master piece and Bastion as I said before is one of my favourite games of all time now.9.75/10"
