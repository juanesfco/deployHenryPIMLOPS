2014-12-19,286040,True,"In my opinion this game was bad but then i learnt that it was made by one man.And now i will be more forgiving of flaws due to lack of man power.Graphics arnt the best (again lack of man power).This is a ok game, Its basically dead space but with zombies.So if you are looking for a low price zombie game this is it!"

2014-01-27,10220,False,Not Bad But not good either i played this for a bit then got bored of there crappy AI they get stuck behind walls none stop! Also enemys can stand in front of a door so you can get through then there hands come through the door so you can still kill them but there bodys block the door so it is impossible and half the time it dosent even work!!!! over all good killing but bad AI.if you are looking for a disapointment get this game.
