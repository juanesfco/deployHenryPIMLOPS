I do like to keep dice rolls and coin flips to a minimum, and let my fate be decided by my own stupidity instead.You have the option of switching out a card every turn to reduce the disadvantages of bad card draw.Having a good deck with rare cards can give you interesting possibilities for various strategies, but it won't win the game for you.Being able to summon a creature and see it brought to life in the playing field.The puzzle challenges are a really fun idea. I've played through them all and always look forward to the daily challenge. Good way to learn the various game mechanics also.I had a technical issue with a bugged Spirit Orb and the support staff sorted it out quickly and were very pleasant to deal with."
