2016-01-24,225840,True,i've been playing this game since the pre steam dayswith each version it gets even betterthis really is the definitive half life modeclassic mode alligns it with the normal game (still co-op)if you don't choose classic mode it brings elements from opposing force (the x race and two more weapon slots)what other mod can you co-op the half life 1 collection with friendsand play as boris from goldeneyeor a giant mushroom?
