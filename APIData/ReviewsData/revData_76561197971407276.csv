2015-11-29,346110,True,"Ark is Epic!I know normally Iâ€™m supposed to write a long and detailed review, but I am pressed for time and a shot and to the point review is what you will get.Ark is fun at first, and with the new content being added daily it refreshes the gameplay and allows the player to explore something new. However I found the endless farming and feeding tedious and repetitive. This is however offset by new content.Understanding that the game is still in early access is important, there are allot of bugs and glitches that spoil the game. However they are quickly fixed and rarely does the same bug affect you more than once. Loading times for the game are terrible even on an SSD, this issues is what put me off the game the most having to preload my game 30 mins before I play is not fun.The game itself is fun and exciting, you have a totally open world where you must survive and live. The dinos are realistic and creative; they offer a great amount of enjoyment to this game! You level up as you play to unlock new items to build and endlessly farm to gain the materials needed to build new items.All in all the game is fun and enjoyable if you can overlook all the current issues it has, I have put well over 300 hours  into it and after about that amount of time it became repetitive and mundane, endlessly harvesting food and materials.If you are into survival games that require farming and RPG mechanics all rolled into one then this is your game!"
