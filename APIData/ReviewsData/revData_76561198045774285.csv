2015-01-26,570,True,The best MOBA game ever made since DotA... Furthermore it is free. WHY THE HECK WOULD YOU NOT PLAY IT. SCREW LEAGUE OF LEGENDS
2015-12-23,730,True,"Well, overall a great game with magnificent maps and awesome community servers. However a terrible competitive system, out of 10 games, you meet trollers in 6 of them and people who afk or abandon early in 2 of them. It's giving us cancer, seriously. Just shut up and play casual/community servers or freaking dota 2 man."
