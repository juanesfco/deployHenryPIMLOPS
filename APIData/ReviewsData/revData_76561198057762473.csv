At first glance through just pictures it looked boring to me but i wanted to give it a shot since my friends were all hyped about it, and i can tell you this, this game is worth the shoti had soo much fun playing this with friends and questing with them, the aspect and atmosphere of the game makes it enjoyable and not taken too seriously just pure casual fun. i would definetly love to see where this game takes off in the future and for now im just having a blastto put it to straight terms. If world of warcraft and minecraft had a baby it would be trove."
