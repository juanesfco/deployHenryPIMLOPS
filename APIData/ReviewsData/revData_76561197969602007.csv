In a time when zombie games are littered everywhere, this game really stands out apart from the rest. It has a strong story line, top of the line parkour mechanics and the day/night change that almost makes it feel like your playing a different game.The engine they are using really brings out the realism in the environment. I never would have thought that i would get weak in the knees from fear of heights when playing a game on a PC, but this game sure does give you that feeling. I'm proud to be an owner of this top of the line AAA title!"

Running this game on hardware that is lower than the minimum spec (running it on a hd5870m), all game details on low or optionally off, and running at a resolution of 1280x768, this game is still a HELL of a lot of fun! The sound effects and music really amplify the experience and immersion. ...nothing like getting a daily dose of demon destruction. "
