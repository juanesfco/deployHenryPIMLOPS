2015-02-21,319630,True,"I love this game so far, first episode is great. It is heavily influenced by the Walking Dead series and other Telltale Games but with no shooting and zombies and all that. But this is a teen drama kind of thing and also does feel like a tv show. Long story short, I recommend buying this game. If you're not sure then at least buy the first episode because it is definitely worth it."
