2015-04-19,339610,False,Tried playing with an Xbox 360 controller. Start the game. get half a dozen free pay-to-play drops for some reason. That can't be good. Go to the tutorial. No controller button mapped for run. Right-o. I'll switch to keyboard. Time to shoot. 'Hold D to shoot'. Hold D. Nothing happens. Try again. Same thing. Try tapping D. Nothing. 'Hold D to shoot'. Naah. Press Esc. 'Hold D to shoot'. Alt-F4 that ♥♥♥♥.
