The whole really is a seris of patterns repeated in a random order. One thing I like was when the central hexagon turned into a pentagon or even a square. But that feature's not used alot, so that was a bit sad, but I can see it was just to add variety to the first/ fourth stage of the game.Overall, my FINAL rating for this game is a 9/10. Something just didn't seem right & for playing for a long time (not over an hour), my forth finger start to hurt a bit. But should you buy this game? YES!!! Is it worth $2.99? DEFINATELY!!!! So, all in all, get this game if you like fast-paced minimalist fast-paced hexagon-based arcade action! But don't if you have strange reactions to flashing lights or anything like that.9/10 would make a hexaflexagon again.Yep, another ?/10 would ? again joke."
