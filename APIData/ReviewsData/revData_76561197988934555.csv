2016-01-01,290300,True,"Forgetting gaming for a few seconds, if you like Blues Rock, then the cost of this game is justified based on the soundtracks alone. The Game is a Bonus.the  game reminds me of Spaz ( Spare Pirates and Zombies ) with a different camera view and in 3D  without the zombies....worth a playthrough"
