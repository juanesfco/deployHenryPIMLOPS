2012-08-15,105600,True,"Where do I begin?Terraria is an amazing game that always leaves you with something to do.This game never disappoints. Want to ride a unicorn while shooting out rainbows? Terraria can do that. Want to fight a giant eye belonging to a dark lord? Terraria can do that. Want to shoot a gun that is also a shark? Terraria can do that. Words cannot describe Terraria. Just get the bloody game already, it's awesome."
