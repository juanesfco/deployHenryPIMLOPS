2015-04-26,307780,False,"EDIT 22/04/16: They aren't fixing this, they are once again neglecting PC players. Shame.  Please don't buy.Sadly, it's hard to take a side with this game. 7.5/10 for Gameplay. 0/10 for Developer Bull ♥♥♥♥.At the point of writing this review 26/4/15, this game shouldn't be purchased. It's riddled with bugs, uses large amounts of memory, should not be played without a gamepad and contains a few shonky business practices.However, i'm going to recommend it because (Remember this my personal opinion) it's my favourite game of the franchise. It has a great story, good characters, longevity with online features and character specialties. I figure when the majority of people read this in the future most of the issues will be fixed. (God I hope so). EDIT: Nevermind, it has no longevity due to the lack of support."
