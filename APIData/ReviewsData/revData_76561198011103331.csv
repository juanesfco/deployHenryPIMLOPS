I can't play like this.EDIT: Let's just add crashing at certain points to that. Stuttering and freezing fixed itself but now doing things like searching for monoliths at beacons can cause crashes."

I have heard complaints about the car AI but in my opinion, it's still realistic as drivers can be just as braindead in real life.This sort of simulation is not for everyone obviously, but if you're looking for a good simulation about traveling all over different parts of europe, shipping supplies in a truck, there's no better game than this one."
