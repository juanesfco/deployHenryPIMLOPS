2013-12-12,24010,True,More fun than you would think :P
2014-01-20,209080,True,First time i posted this review i was disappointed but if you check the comments of this review the developers took a look at it and fixed all my server/lag problems so thanks Guns Of Icarus. At least you care about you players :)
2014-08-02,301520,True,If minecraft and world of tanks had a baby it would be this. Sadly this baby was dropped on its head when it was small because it is VERY VERY PAY TO WIN. The gamplay is fun and all players robots are balanced into tiers 1-10 but even a tier 1 players who have spent real money can kill you almost instantly because they have access to over powered parts. Wanted to like this game but couldnt force myself.
2014-06-15,251060,True,Good however is not quite worth the cash mainly because of the lack of content. Still im sure once the game is completed it will be just as good as the previous game (which was incredible). Also the current naval combat is quite limited but is improving with each update.
2014-04-20,44350,False,Graphics are ok. Cars handle well. But this is the most frustrating racer out there. You can crash into anything and die however the AI cant die. literally cant die. If you wanna know whats its like to play this just hit yourself in the face with a bat.
2014-02-01,208090,False,All outfits cost real money. Couldnt buy any gun parts because 'There was a error connecting to ubers services' then the game claimed that the Australian server was no longer avalible. switched to U.S still couldnt buy any gun parts. gameplay was pretty decent though.
2014-01-02,241540,True,This is probably my favourite open world zombie game. Maybe even better than DayZ if you like single player. scavengeing fighting driving and even homebuilding are a part of it. DO NOT PLAY IT WITHOUT AN XBOX CONTROLLER IT DOES NOT LIKE THE MOUSE!!!
