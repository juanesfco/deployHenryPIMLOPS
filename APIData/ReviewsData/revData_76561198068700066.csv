Then guess what, Postal 2 Complete is the game for you. Will you solely judge a game base on a Metacritic score? Nah not me, I'd rather see how that game plays out itself in the entertainment value and I'm not gonna lie, this game delivers just that. But hey if satirical humor is not your thing, then Postal 2 ain't ya gig, ya dig?"

The story is great thus far and there's plenty of side quests and other little goodies to keep you occupied from even the main story, as completing them will get you rare items like armor parts and weapons with better mods on them. The perk system is great and gives ease of access to the character type you wanna run, my current build is a melee/pistol stealthy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that dispatches a lot of unaware enemies, though I won't leave out that sneak mode is still pretty fickle and broken a lot of the time.There's a good number of companions, though unlike New Vegas allowing you to run with 2, you are only allowed to have one with you at all times, a small draw back, but it makes it easier, still careful since you companion can sometime kinda pull you into conversations in the midst of combat which makes for humorous moments or they kinda ♥♥♥♥ you over in trying to disarm traps and just walk right into them, otherwise, gathering them is worth your time because most of them have a great sense of charm and you'll easily become attached to a few of them.The change to the Power Armor mechanics as it to being more akin to a knight set over your normal wears without it on can make all the difference in some battles with what you decide to tackle head out and can be helpful to help you collect junk in the wasteland to mod weapon parts, armor parts, settlements and other things such as repairs to the armor itself.There ARE side quests, you just have to look out for them, can't really miss them, you get pretty good loot and benefits for your labor to completing them.You'll level up pretty fast in this game verus the other Fallouts, which can seemingly take forever, forcing you mostly to complete quests just to level up most of the time compared to grinding, which makes since, Fallout is not a grind heavy game compared to a game like Monster Hunter is. And with leveling up faster having no level caps like the other Fallout does, the leveling system is far better beyond compare as FO 3/NV, the cap was LV 30 if you didn't have DLC, which only brought the cap up to LV 50, making it a bit more punishing on try to get the right build you want to run with.The settlement/building system was a mod in pervious Fallout games, like NV that people made, Bethseda has added such a system to bring that very idea to this game and it's great, because now the junk in the wasteland suddenly no longer becomes junk, it's junk you need to support your settlements to keep them supplied and well defended.Overall, Bethseda did a great job with this game, it's a great game and despite the few flaws and bugs, which can easily be fixed via performance issues. you can easily look past all of it. If your a fan of Fallout, get this game, it capitalize on a lot the other vanilla Fallouts didn't have unless you had mods added to them."
