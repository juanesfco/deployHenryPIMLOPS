2016-09-15,330840,False," (Spoilers ahead so do not read this unless you dont mind the ending being spoilt) Telltale has a history of games that 'the choices affect the story' that hardly change how everything turns out but this is by far the worst case as the house will fall regardless of the choices you make in the game. The only things that change is where some characters are at certain times. I could not recommend this game for $30, I would just recommend that you watch a playthrough or if you really want it that you should just wait untill it goes on sale."
