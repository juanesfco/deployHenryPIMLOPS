Then I see two guys running towards me shouting friendly they had no gear, I shouted friendly back they said they were going to meet up with there friend so we run along the coast and stop at some buildings to loot. I found a pistol and a orange saloon backpack i stuff my pistol in it and pray they didn't see we kept running, one guy fell behind so I go back and put a bullet in his head. and screamed shots after I looted him, he had beans..... I just tried to catch up but I couldn't but i just followed until he stopped and then he just fell to the ground.Then i heard more bullets there were six bandits just firing at will, i run behind the trees and go prone and then I shot backbut i heard a clicking noise and realized i was out of ammo i keep sprinting along the coast until i find a village and there is a splitting axe in the shed. i sprint back knowing this was a bad idea but i charge the tree line and scream I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE BANDITS i hit one of them twice he falls to the grong but hes still talking then i realize they were all pointing there guns at me 1 pulled out handcuffs and said 'stay still for me' I wasscared to death because i know what bandits to to people in this game he got the axe and finished offthe bandit on the floor for some reason and started punching me and feeding me rotten food and disinfectant i want to log off but i will be stuck hear for ever so i just let them do what they do then suddenly shots i looked at the bandits they weren't shooting they were getting shot i shout friendly over and over the guys shooting the bandits must have been bandits because after they were dead i was to.
