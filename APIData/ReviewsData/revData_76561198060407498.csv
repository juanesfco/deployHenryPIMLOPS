2016-07-28,261570,True,"This game has an astonishingly compelling story, amazing mechanics, challenging and beautiful level design, and the soundtrack is probably the best I've ever heard for a game. I 100% recommend this game to anyone who likes games for with a good story, and all the stuff I've said this game has earlier, especially if you like platformers, and if you've never played a platformer and want to try one out then this game would be perfect"

2016-02-02,209650,False,Literaly the failed abortion of Halo and Call of Duty filled with DLC's and trash mechanics. (It's ♥♥♥♥ing trash).
2015-07-18,8190,True,"This game is amazingly fun. Pretty average story but the explosions, guns and vehicles make up for it. All in all very fun to play. But don't expect it to be realistic."
