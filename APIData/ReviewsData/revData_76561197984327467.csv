2015-05-11,4000,True,I would have to say that this game is one of my favourites as it has millions of things to do from sandbox messing around to roleplaying to hide and seek. Hours and hours of fun has been had on this game and i definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone.
2015-05-11,303390,True,This game is a fun game that is very challenging. Due to it being made by one person i would have to say it is very well made as there isn't much content in the game but can create an hour or so of fun/raging. It uses blocks for the creation of everything. Overall i would have to say that this game was a good investment of a dollar as I enjoyed playing it.
2015-05-11,248570,True,This game is a fun game based around the movement of joints and the fighting of characters. It is a fun game that involves strategic moves and intense fighting situations. You can go up against real players or you can create your own scenarios with many different game modes and mods to play.
2015-01-03,730,True,A great improvement from the previous counterstrike as in now includes a competitive side to it. With the competitive play it brings a whole new side of the game bringing out the gamer in all. This first person shooter uses a round by round game play in which weapons are bought each round. I believe that it out runs all other FPS games in the industry.
