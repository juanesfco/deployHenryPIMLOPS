2014-12-12,204300,False,"I have been playing this game for such a long time that I don't even remember when I started playing it, the game is fun and it is simple, 2d grafics, the soundtrack is great and the game has several different heroes to play it with all kinds of gameplays, the reason I chose this game was because my pc is quiet old and slow so I can't play games more sophisticated, but it has some serious issues, like lag and rage quit players that can't destroy the fun of playing it. The game doesn't have a official host so players must host the matches and that is quiet terrible since some players don't have good conexions to host it. You can quit a match whenever you want without punishment which I think it is a problem that the creators must solve as fast as they can. I'll not recomend the game since those two issues are quiet bad for an online game. But if you don't mind for lag players or rage quit I can say for sure you will have some fun playing it.ps: sorry for my bad english."
