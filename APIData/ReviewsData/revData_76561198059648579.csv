2014-04-05,277430,True,For $5 this game is worth your time.Pretty easy to pick up and play with simple controls and fun gameplay. dont be worried that the game will be runied by microtranactions cause they dont really change the game at all.Graphics have a really nice feel the them and sound is really good.Hopfully this game will pave the path for future halo games to come to PC.
