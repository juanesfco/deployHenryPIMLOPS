2014-11-17,4000,True,"This game is amazing! You can do so much stuff in it. You can be in a city, you can freebuild, you can be in a gang, you can have deathmatches, you can play minigames, watch youtube videos in-game, The possibilities are endless!!"
2014-11-17,105600,True,"Yes! A very fun game. Hours and hours of my own have been put in to this game and wow, was that time spent well. This game is a sandbox game, of course, but it's that extra combat and good extra combat that tops off this game and makes it one of the best games i've ever played. Buy it!"
2015-11-07,315660,True,"This is a great game for any train lover out there. It's not just a simulator for driving trains, but a complete RAILROAD simulator, how cool is that! Plus, there's millions and millions of trains that you can drive, from any country you can think of :)This games a lot of fun, I rate it 10/10."
2014-11-17,24010,True,"A very well-done train simulator. The simulation aspect of this game is beautiful, you actually feel like you are in control of a real-life train! There's also a world builder, but it seems like you need to be smarter than I to work that labyrinth of hell. Good game if you just wanna drive."
2014-11-17,304930,True,"Indeed a lot of fun. It can kinda be annoying that you can get killed so easily, but that could be just that i suck at the game xD. Buy it, it's really a lot of fun!"
2014-11-17,250340,False,"I do not recommend this game. Sure, you can build in it. Sure, you can fight in it and play minigames. But all your builds are restricted to a strict grid system, and all you can do is wander about a static world. Very boring, IMO. Do not buy unless you want to waste your money!"
