There are additions to the game that would have been welcomed but all in all it was a good game. I personally would of loved a 'respec' feature. Reading a description of a skill/talent is different than using it in combat. Just my .02 USD.I would appreciate a 'story' mode, but it would not be a deal breaker for me playing the game. A suggestion if possible is auto resolve battles like Rome Total War. I know they are not the same thing. But it was the first example I had in my head. Like crunch the numbers of the current heroes versus the current enemies and get a prediction of who would win. Then decide to fight it out or CPU resolve it for time-saving.I liked the isometric map. It made the game more immersive. I liked having some freedom to pursue my quest completion. I think many people are comparing this game to Loren The Princess of the Amazon. I see that as fair but not accurate. These are two different games with two different scopes and scales of the world of Aravorn. The scope SOTW is magnified and the game is epic for different reasons. The fighting was different than Loren, but it was a small learning curve for any RPG veteran to overcome.I didn't know there were over 100 battles in the game. I guess people played this game for different reasons. I played it to flesh out the romances and was captivated by the humor. The story was palpable due to the great writing and art. I can see why people can be turned off from this game due to the number of battles."
