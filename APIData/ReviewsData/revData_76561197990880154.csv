2011-11-27,25010,True,"Captivating and compelling storyline on par with the best such as the Metal Gear, Final Fantasy  and Zelda series. Gorgeous and alluring graphics and visual effects that truly puts the CryEngine 3 and Unreal Engine 3 to shame, and audio fidelity that makes Battlelfield 3 sound like an 8 bit classic. BEST GAME EVER."
