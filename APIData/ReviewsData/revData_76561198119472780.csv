2016-04-30,57640,True,"This is one of my favourite point and click games. The music is great, the puzzles are not too difficult that you need a walkthrough (and even if you do get stuck, the game has an in-built hint system which is awesome) and the characters are witty and humourous. The quality of the voice overs are a bit dubious but other than that, it's a fantastic little murder mystery with conspiracies abound. If you love the Knights Templar you will adore the story line, and if you don't, well, you'll love it anyway because the game also teaches you a bit of history. Definitely give it a go!"

2016-02-22,248530,True,I love this game. It's so beautiful and relaxing. I love how there is more to do than catch fish. You can explore and collect items and just take in your surroundings. I think this would be gorgeous on Occulus Rift.
2016-02-20,346560,True,This is actually really fun.
2016-02-05,347610,True,These were quite good. My favourite was the third one.
2016-01-05,342580,True,This shouldn't be as fun as it is.
2015-12-16,392450,True,This is excellent.
2015-11-22,331440,False,This is boring and irritating.
2015-11-22,334230,True,"Absolutely love this game. You find yourself playing and playing to win coins to buy new skins and houses. The community is fairly good, sometimes you get a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bags but mostly everyone is pretty good. Despite the fact that you don't really have to do much except watch, it does have a load of suspense and you end up really getting into it. Definitely recommend."
