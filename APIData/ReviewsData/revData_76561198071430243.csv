2014-07-25,233720,True,Its just an over the top game and it has some weird physics but just make it more fun to play and over all its totally worth buying. I really recomend it if your looking for a fun slightly challenging game with a low download witch ive been looking for lately but havn't found. Hope this helped at least a little.
