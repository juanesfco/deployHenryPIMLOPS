2016-09-10,730,False,"This game if ♥♥♥♥ing broke, you will get ♥♥♥♥ing angry playing this ♥♥♥♥, i've hit 3 shots in a row with the awp in the middle of the CT's chest, and when i walked away i got ♥♥♥♥ing teleported back to where i was and died, ♥♥♥♥ING FIX THIS ♥♥♥♥!"
2016-07-28,295110,False,"Not cool at all.Horrible PVP, since there are not much servers, you can fight a chinese guy when ur from Africa, and many other incredibly combinations, and 90% of the time your weapon is gonna be a bow, making it literally impossible.Looting is not worth many times, there are lots of places to search, but you may end looting a whole building and end up finding Ground Coffe. Ammo is a joke, super rare to find, and when you finnaly find them they are in like 1 or 2 bullets, and you cant craft them.Some of the updates only ♥♥♥♥ the game even more, removing some craftable items that are impossible to get or making them way harder to make.And honestly, wy the ♥♥♥♥ an ALPHA game as a ♥♥♥♥ing crate system that contains items that are worth over 100$ ??? The custumizable skins that you get in the crate could be looted and it would be way way more fun, but no, the devs just want you money.- 3/10"
