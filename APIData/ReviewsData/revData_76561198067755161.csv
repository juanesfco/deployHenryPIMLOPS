My computer can run heavily modded and graphically enhanced Minecraft, Dayz, etc, but 7D2D crashes.This isnt much of a problem as 7D2D closes instantly and only takes about 10 seconds to open up as it loads extremely quickly.What IS the problem is that THERE'S NO MANUAL SAVE FUNCTION, so if you find a gun, build a house and store supplies, it can crash without autosaving and send me back an hour. However I do have a 32-bit OS, which may be the cause of crashes I don't know.I WOULDN'T BUY THIS GAME UNTIL IT HAS A MANUAL SAVE FUNCTION the lack of one is shocking in a game that rewards you for putting in time (e.g to contruct a fort, play around in creative, etc.) The autosave it does have seems to trigger at certain intervals, but there's no way to trigger it yourself or toggle it. And sometimes it works every 3 minutes, and sometimes it still dosen't work after 1 hour! That might be just my computer though. I wouldn't reccomend 7D2D as of yet, but with a manual save function I would. When it works it is great fun, especially with friends."

I would have made my own server, but for some reason I don't have an Ipv4 address, so I can't.This game would be 8 or 9 out of 10 for me if it had dedicated servers."
