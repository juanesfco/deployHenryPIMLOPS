2014-03-09,221100,True,"One of the best 3D survival games, still adding a few things but really fun to play, cuffing people and stealing their stuff or killing them is really fun.One of the things I hate is that when you die you lose your stuff so I could have spent a day getting good stuff and getting to a certain spot and then I die either from a zombie or most likely from a person."
