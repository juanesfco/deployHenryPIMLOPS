2016-09-08,322500,True,"TBH// This game was OVERhyped, I fell in love with the short but meaningful story, but the game wasn't like the trailers (much like most games) but I really had a good feeling about it. Sometimes the game can be hard. ( 7.8/10 ) *too much slow motion*"
2016-09-08,4000,True,"Its very good! Even after years of playing I still somehow find myself on this game, BUT, the bad physics engine can be funny, however, its very buggy and annoying. Crashes aren't rare either. The support is massive and thats what keeps the game going. ( 9/10 ) *too much water*"
2016-09-08,238460,True,"The Game is very funny with only mild teen humor (how is that possible) I love it, very fun. but you could introduce and EASY mode just for messing around that has like 3 lives and checkpoints, but the timed runs are difficult. ( 8.7/10 ) *too many cats*"
