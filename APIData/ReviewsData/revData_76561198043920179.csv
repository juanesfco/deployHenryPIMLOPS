2013-11-30,200510,True,one of the best gamz of 2012. Best turn-based stratergy of the year. Get it on sale cuz it costs too much normaly. If I had to state an error it would be the lack of a autosave file even though it says it does. I lost about 6 hours of gameplay and corrupt save files happen too frequently. If the replay value wasn't so high then I wouldn't play the game so much

2014-01-01,211820,False,"I would wait for the full game to come out before buying it, and seeing what content will be added. I will play it every time there is an update, because I feel unmotivated to progress in such a system. Terreria you get ore, build better stuff, progress further in the cave, and explore more. I haven't found a single cave in starbound that I felt like exploring or progressing in. Terreria was a more free style game. you could upgrade your equipment based on what kind of cave you were exploring. But in starbound they give you an objective that you have to follow in an rpg style of gameplay. The guide in terreria is a better help than this poor excuse for a 'tutorial' that this game needs for the stupid rpg elements it throws in just because it try's to be better than terreria instead of building on its core elements like a normal sequal does."
