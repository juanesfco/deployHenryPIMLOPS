2015-01-14,730,True,Counter Strike: Global Offensive is better than Call Of Duty: The Video Game so don't get COD get Counter Strike ok.I recomend this game for anyone all ages especially 8-12 year-olds it's really great for young minds to get into mindless killing. Unfortunately there was a major lack of dank memes wich lead to vulgar and explicit language across the globe creating even as much as riots but the game is still good so get it because it's good.10/7-Wasn't Call Of Duty
