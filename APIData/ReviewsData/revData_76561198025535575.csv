2016-02-25,222880,True,Still the best first person shooter. From close up to sniper its alwsys fun.
2015-12-24,301640,False,This had so much promise but the feel of the game is jerky and the shooting is way to random. Missing the fun that L4D has sadly. Can only hope future updates bring this back.
