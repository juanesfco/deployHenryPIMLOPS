2015-10-30,319630,False,"-Unlikeable and forgettable cast of characters-Predictible story-Intresting game play mechanic but used very poorly-Most choices lead to slightly different outcomes that are pointless-Cringe worthy dialog-Bad lip syncing-Choices have no real impact and are rendered pointless by the end of episode 5-Max's powers are never explained -Chole -Boring gameplay+This game is finally complete+Some good music+The graphic were okFinal verdict-This game had the potential to be great, but it is boged down by poor story teling, boring gameplay, bad cast of characters, and bad dialog. Never have I been so bored playing a game, I was hoping for this game to pict up, but after 5 episode all I felt was a extreme sence of boredom and disappointment.It sad that best part of this game for me is when I uninstalled it.0.5/10"
