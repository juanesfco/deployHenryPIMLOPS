2014-11-29,24240,True,"Sunday Morning, my alarm was yelling at me, but I didn't care, I got my gear and had my average cereal, the phone rang, I went over to pick it up, 'you ready for today?' said the voice on the other line, 'yeah I'm outside' I responded, I quickly finished of everything else and headed for the door, sure enough the van pulled up, I jumped in the back, I sat down facing my best friend and old college roommate. It must have been about a 50 minute drive, I was feeling nervous, all four of us pilled out, I went up to scout the place from the inside, everyone else stayed behind. When I walked in, I was met with a security guard, he seemed to be daydreaming, I went over to the canteen area, no sign of any guards, perfect, I pulled out my mask and got out my trusty five-seven, 'everyone down on the ground!' I yelled, the guard from earlier came over, I shot him, all my colleges flooded through the doors taking civilians left and right, I ran upstairs to find the manager, when I got up, more guards, good thing I had body armour, of course I shot them, I felt terrible, these guards probably have young children. I met my colleges back downstairs, I had the thermite already so we could get drilling, we rushed back across the main room, there had to be at least 20 cops at the entrance, worst thing was that they all shot in syncronization, We all went down, Chains, Wolf, Hoxton and me.7.5/10"
