2015-02-17,214950,True,"Whilst everyone was 'hyped' about to sequel to CA's invincible Rome: Total War, I was patient. I didn't rush ahead and pre-purchase a game that could be either really impressive or unstable/un-playable. Coincidently it turned out upon release that the game was terrible (cough* cough* rushed by SEGA as evident in other titles cough* cough* COH2). So i waited; regulary reading reviews, watching gameplay and dev changelogs. I then purchased the game when the emperor editon was released. Instantaniously, the ratio of positive and negative reviews was leaning towards the positive approach. So i purchased the game  with the Greek states DLC on a steam sale Sepember last year for a great price of $20.At that point in which i purchased the game i was impressed, beautiful graphics, animations and mechanics which were not exactly historically accurate but were enjoyable and rewarding. If i had any negative comeents at this current stage, it would be the numerous overpriced DLCs which i believe was influenced by SEGA (cough* cough* COH2 has the same issue). Another complaint is the weakness of the Greek Hoplite/Pike phalanx. I do not like the fact that sword beats the dori phalanx as historically if a unit collided head on with a phalnx, they would become what is known as the modern day souvlaki. I rate this game 92/100 at its CURRENT stage."
