2016-01-09,222880,True,"I've really enjoyed Insurgency; purchased it recently for myself and friends as a Christmas present with the Steam sale.One of those friends described it as 'very intense', I'd have to agree. It seems pretty realistic for a game. It reminded me of an updated 'America's Army' game, which had the same realistic 1-3 bullets and you're dead mechanic. And that's a good thing, if you like some realism. It reminds me a little of paintball, except better accuracy and with real weapons. The 'suppression' feature is really cool, and reminds me of the effect that paintballs whizzing around your head has.I much prefer it to the various CS as the recoil/bullet spreading seems more realistic, and the loadouts are not related to success in the game. It's just a fixed budget of points and weight, to distribute how you see fit. This makes it more newbie-fair. The allocation of members of your team into a fixed breakdown of pickable roles is good because it prevents an accumulation of snipers on teams. Often the 'Support' or 'Machinegunner' role goes unused, which suits me as I enjoy playing it. Once you get the bipod setup lying prone, behind some concealment or cover, it's a lot of fun because the recoil is gone and you can suppress or kill. It suits a somewhat older gamer like me with slower reaction times, because as you fire you are suppressing and then you can eventually hone in and mow them down. Heavy armor often extends your life a bit.Speaking of concealment vs cover, that is definitely something you learn to adapt to. It's a lot of fun shooting through some corrugated iron or wooden boxes, especially with AP bullets, to kill someone crouching behind them.The emphasis on achieving objectives to win, points for taking objectives and killing opposition at the objective instead of just raw K/D ratio makes for a great teamwork environment. If you snipe, you snipe to capture the objective (countersniping or covering the objective). It's really fun with good teamwork, especially if someone who knows  what they are doing is instructing players what to do and boosting morale.I don't even notice that the engine is supposedly old, at least it was inexpensive and ran on my machine. Looks good enough compared to old games I am familiar with."
