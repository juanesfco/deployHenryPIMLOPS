2014-04-04,219150,True,"wow, just wow. I have always wanted to get this game, but I had conscerns on wether or not I would enjoy dying and failing so much, but within 5 mins of playing my breath was taken away, I was blown away by the pure simplicity and flow the game has. Even when dying over and over again there is very little rage, well a tiny bit which is to be expected :PThe combat and movement is very fluid and it is so satisfying to string together a combo, or emerge from a room leaving a trail of dead corspes behind you.The only real gripes I have with it is a sometimes dodgy aiming system, as a lot of the time I die from not facing the right direction when swinging a melee weapon, but it is most likely due to my supbar mouse skills due to my console peasantry"
