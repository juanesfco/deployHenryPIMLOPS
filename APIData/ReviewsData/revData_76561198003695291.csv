2016-04-24,410110,True,"- Somewhat buggy- At times unforgiving and unfair- Art style can be disorientating- Reload mechanics are cumbersomeBut...When you're running around with bullets flying, the music pumping and the bodies piling up.... None of that matters. Excellent fun."
2016-08-27,241930,False,It's the same 'go to this marker' open world action game you have played a 100 times before. Except this time it's in Mordor!!!  Boring and over-hyped.
2016-07-05,278360,True,Bit too short and a bit too easy but I enjoyed it. Get it if you want something fun and relaxing
2015-12-20,261570,True,"Great are style, graphics and gameplay. Also nails the most important thing for any platformer game. The controls. They are super tight and responsive. So many platform games could learn a thing or two from this game about good responsive controls."
2015-06-20,20500,True,The perfect game after a horrible long day at work.-Open World-Destructive Enviroment-Big Explosions-Many bad guys-Wonky physics-Ridiculous vehicles-Awful Voice acting and B-grade storyYES PLEASE!
2015-06-06,295790,False,"The art style is great and charming, however the platforming elements and controls are beyond frustrating and feel horribly clunky. Especially once you are two-thirds through the game it becomes even more frustrating!"
2014-11-01,260230,True,"Great simple game, that tells an excellent story.  Art style really suits the game and strikes the right balance between making the game enjoyable and showing the brutality of the war (especially towards the end). The narrative and historical facts you pick up during the game are a great addition and you will learn a few things about life in World War 1. The gameplay is quite basic, with puzzles being quite simple and can get quite repetative at times but are still enjoyable. My only criticism is that the 'skill' based action sequences can get quite annoying and you find yourself dieing a lot. You will find yourself passing them wth simply trial and error. Thankfully automatic save points are plentifull in this game. Would highly recommend."
