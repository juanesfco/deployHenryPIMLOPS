Thought and precise movements must be taken into account if you wish for all of your squad mates to survive the incursion."

2016-01-31,236510,False,"I think it had a lot of potential, however the devs didnt quite make it. Instead the tried to make a rainbow six siege/SWAT game. Not to mention its a dead game, no servers, no players and no support. If its on sale for $1.00 i would pick it up, if not stay away."
