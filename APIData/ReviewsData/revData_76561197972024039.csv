The problem I've found is that Opusfsx weather software dose not work with this game I can't even brows to the folder where the Steam Edition is located.I was just wondering If anyone has tried Installing REX Texture direct to make the game look better, I'm thinking about trying this tomorrow but I first want to get feedback from those who may have tried this."
