2015-07-10,212680,True,"One of the most rage inducing games, and you need to play it, If you love getting constantly punched in the ♥♥♥♥ (or ♥♥♥♥♥♥, I don't discriminate), you will love this game, and, If you don't love getting constantly punched in genitalia, you love it even more, this was my opening to the world of rogue like games. I cannot recommend this enough, and, my real life friends (I know right, rare) cannot shut me up about this game.This game beats me, and makes me feel useless, but then again, I could never stay mad at it, because deep in its heart, I know it loves me, well I think it does anyways, I mean it beats me because it loves me, you wouldn't understand."
