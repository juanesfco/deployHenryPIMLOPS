2015-02-07,342380,True,"The game is great with it's images and storylineIt provides an environment to interact with and chooseThe only downside is, the game itself is too short, and as much as I liked the game itselfI am kind of disappointed about only getting roughly 2 hours worth of dialouge, sure it's great don't get me wrong but, 2 hours? I really wish it was more then 2 hours worth of interesting stuff but oh well, it was alright but the only thing I would have to complain about besides the shortness of it is the cost of it, for 2 hours worth of gameplay I think at least it could be $5."
