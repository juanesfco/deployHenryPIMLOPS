2014-09-20,265550,True,"Lots of fun! Running around finding things to essentially duct-tape together weapons is a great mechanic, and executed quite well. Extend this to the creation of new vehicles, ala rollerhog; a motorcycle with a steamroller drum on the front.. oh and some flamethrowers to boot.. and you've got a recipie for a lot of zomb-hem. Zomb..saster? Zombtato?There are a few things that bug me, the worst probably being the occasional inability to pick up what you actually want despite looking directly at it. Turn your stance a bit and the item highlights.. but hey, your character wants to do a full 90 degree turn, not just 45 degrees, so again you lose the highlight and can't pick up the item.. or worse yet you pick up a cardboard box instead of an assault rifle. Some of the travel missions are a pain in the butt, sending you to all four corners of the city,. On the upside, big missions tend to have bigger rewards, but a few times I felt like I'd wasted a heap of effort. There was also a single boss mechanic which just didnt seem to work well, though I had no trouble getting through it; I still felt like it hadnt been played out the way the designers intended. Hmm.. I might watch the video on that one to see how it was meant to go down.I see a lot of potential in the co-op system, though ended up turning it off myself as the first person who jumped in was an internet-tard and decided to start swearing because I wasnt on a mic. Thankfully you can change the co-op mode at any time. I would probably play through this with a friend in co-op mode.I rate this at least three potatoes out of an unknown amount, it was very playable and had so many sweet combos and a decent player upgrade system. I rarely got stuck on missions and smaller simpler missions didnt make you work too hard, with the components for completion reasonably easy to find. Do keep in mind that some areas will be locked until further down the track, so don't try for too long to get a blueprint or collectable if it seems like you shouldn't be in the area just yet. I have seen a bunch of stuff on the net about people who couldnt play this with nvidia graphics - i'm running a radeon so I guess not much problem there for me, though might be worth researching just in case."
