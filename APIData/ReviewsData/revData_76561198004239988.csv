2015-06-08,22380,False,"Skyrim + Borderlands had a deformed baby.I was expecting something really good, as the new hype for fall out 4 is around the internet, I thought well why not give this a try.-I don't like walking 1000 miles to point A and point B. -The walk is so boring, you might come across a few enemies if you're lucky, -The battle system is just silly, Using VAT with more than 2 enemies is a death sentence.-The ADS is inaccurate. -The interface isn't that great, epecially the markers for quests, One quest Ill have 3 markers to walk miles to north, then south, then east. WTF.If you like a game that-Has good NPC's-Decent attention to detail-Has most your gametime walkingThen go for it.Will not buy fallout 4."
