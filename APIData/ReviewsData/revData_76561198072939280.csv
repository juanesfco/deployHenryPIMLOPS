2015-06-25,363970,True,AWESOME game... good time waster if you are into that sort of thing. like the layout + ascenion style gameplay. also really challenging to get to those higher levels
2015-02-22,302270,True,"Wicked Game!DDE started out as a remake of Dungeon Defenders, which was an EPIC game (if i do say so myself). But since DDE's release its become something more then Dungeon Defenders, Because of its constant getting updated, its gotten alot more content and the leveling system was changed in Dungeon Defenders they level cap was eventually raised to lvl 100 which the intro of new patches. as where with Dungeon Defenders Eternity, all that content is already in, but the level cap is sitting back at the original cap of lvl 60, which allows alot more room for upgrades in the future.BY FAR THE BEST MMO Tower Defense game, i've seen out there. although its not fully a tower defense game, because you can also run around as a character and shoot, swing big ♥♥♥♥ swords, fire lasers, use magic projectile to kill you're enemies or you could just sit back and let you're towers and pets do the killing for you. This game covers alot of different play styles and is great fun with friends or by yourself.of course every game isn't without if flaws or boring parts. a couple of boring parts i've found are the massive grinds to get end level gear (although this might be boring, it can also be quite enjoyable). Dungeon Defenders Eternity took everything about Dungeon Defenders and made it even better.But don't take my word on it, play it for yourself and enjoy!!!"
