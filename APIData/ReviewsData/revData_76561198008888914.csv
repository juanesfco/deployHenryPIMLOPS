Great if you have a friend over and want to play a short 2-player game. Not really worth 15$ dollars, wait till it's on sale"

If you love seeing slow-mo cinematics of your enemies' heads exploding into pieces, this is a great game for you.'Fallout V.A.T.S. on steroids'"

2016-06-28,422970,True,I have to play this whenever I feel hyper/ want to relieve stress. It's way too good for such a small game
