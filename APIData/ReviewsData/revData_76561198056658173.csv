Who really needs graphics to enjoy a game, this game does great with its unique graphics style and turn based actions. No matter how many times you die, you keep reaching for the NEW GAME button and end up trying all sorts of different skill sets which will completely change the style of play, from sneaking around in forest harvesting for recources or killing everything you see then eating their corpse in a worse case scenario. You roam around the waste land searching for information about yourself and meet all sorts of characters from tribes people to crazy cultists!"
