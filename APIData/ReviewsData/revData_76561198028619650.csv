2014-12-16,238090,True,"10/10 recommended for psychological warfareBreakdown on my first mission on Authentic difficultyDoing well, killed all the spotters with a little difficulty, since I'm adjusting to the m1. Killed the truck after shooting about 20 times. No big problems so far.. Silently killed a couple guys with my knife. Ok, so far so good. Then it got to the point where the game told me to pull out my welrod (a silenced pistol), I pulled it out and killed about 2 people with it. Then suddenly, dun dun dun, theres a sound indicator on the top of screen! I had a sudden rush of stupidity and pulled out my SMG thinking, 'Hey, there's artillery fire, it should block out the sound of my MSG right?' Wrong. These Germans know, they know you are there, wherever you are hiding. I killed a guy with the SMG timing it with the artillery fire. Then a German soldier just started yelling out stuff saying 'I know you're there!'. I immediately backed away, but this guy didn't even need to find me, he knows exactly where I am. He knows I killed his mate and he knows exactly, where the shots came from. As soon as he found the dead body of his mate, he faced right and immediately started firing, me getting scared from his taunts and sudden shots, pulled the trigger (I even accidentally pushed my mouse up, so I had to re-aim) and suprisingly killed him after emptying my clip. At this point, I was completely scared, shivering even. I thought I had killed all of the Germans in the small area, but no, I was wrong. A German kept calling out, I know you're there. I didn't have a choice but to move up to the 2 Germans I killed. Then.. bullets from the side, I didn't even had time to react. The German knew the exact time I was going to cross the T-shaped intersection. He knew exactly when to shoot. The game took me to the 'game over' screen but I can hear his laughter, the laughter of a devil."
