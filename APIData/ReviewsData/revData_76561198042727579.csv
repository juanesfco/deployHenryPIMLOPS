The puzzles are very unique, making you think outside the box.Working with shadows and lights, makes for a very different atmosphere and way of thinking. I am just absolutely in love with this game.The only downside is the story line isn't as full as it could have been. But I know the developers were low on funds and time and had to cut a MASSIVE part of their plans out. Looking forward to their upcoming game :)"
2014-06-20,250620,True,This is by far one of my favourite games. Exploring the world of a childs imagination accompanied by his best friend the teddy in search of his mother. The ending shows you the harsh reality that no kid should have to go through.
