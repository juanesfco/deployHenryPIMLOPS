2012-08-18,28050,True,"This is one of those must play games. If you like Mass Effect 2's graphic style and colour scheme, you'll like this, and even if you like Mass Effect 1/2 in general you'll most likely enjoy this. It's super fun playing stealth. Plus, you can stab civilians on the street with your arm blades! What more could you want?"
