2014-03-18,240,True," What is Counter Strike: Source? It is a multiplayer first-person shooter which is a remake of the original Counter Strike that focuses on the teams of Counter-Terrorists against Terrorists, this game includes plenty of maps including some well known maps such as de_dust2 with the gamemode of Bomb defusal and cs_office having the gamemode of Hostage rescue.This game involves quite a bit of skill unlike other first-person shooters out there which can be hard to get used to. How it Works This game takes quite a bit of skill as said previously, it requires knowledge and understanding of the game. This can mean learning the economics of the game, from nade usage to shooting and compnesating spray control. As you progress you will start to learn these things. Learning is what makes this game longer-lasting and more enjoyable than other first-person shooters. Popular Gamemodes  Bomb Defusal This is a gamemode with the main objective where the Counter-Terrorists try to prevent the Terrorists from planting at either Bomb sites A or B. There are 2 ways that will give you victory, as Counter-Terrorists you can eliminate the enemy team or defuse the bomb before it explodes. When playing as Terrorist you can win doing the same thing as the Counter-Terrorists which is eliminating the enemy team or planting the bomb and letting it explode. Hostage Rescue A gamemode which has hostages that are placed where the Terrorist spawn, same concept with the wiping out enemy team but instead of the Terrorists objective to plant the bomb, it is the Counter-Terrorist to rescue the hostages and take them back to where the Counter-Terrorists spawn. Custom Gamemodes Lastly in Counter Strike: Source you will be seeing a lot of custom maps and servers which make up majority of the servers nowadays. These gamemodes go from minigames to bhop and surf with plenty of other custom gamemodes to chose from. Custom gamemodes are especially fun to play when you are bored or just looking for something to play with your mates. Conclusion Well worth buying it if it goes on sale a little bit cheaper as it is a little old and not worth the $20 at the moment. Worth all the 200+ hours on this game however there aren't as much servers as they use to be because it is getting old and there are mods that are available which are a load of fun to play such as Jailbreak and Zombies. Hands down the best game for its time and maybe even today (at least for me). I do recommend this game to those who are thinking of purchasing it although you better purchase it soon as servers are getting wiped. Although if you are still wanting the Counter Strike Experience you can switch over to CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offensive). Its a good alternative but I still prefer Counter Strike: Source over it9.5/10"
