2014-08-13,218620,False,As ive said in my Teamfortress 2 review this game went from amazing banking game to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wreck. The game was amazing but now DLC and micro transaction rule. I was fine with the addition of skins but giving them stats cmon Almir you said it was free you d*ckwad and you said payday 2 would never have micro transactions. We are disapointed OVERKILL. Just remove the crates or atleast the additional stats :(
