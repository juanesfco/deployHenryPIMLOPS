Personally I have not given this a try, but if you are experiencing pathfinding issues play the game at normal speed.The game seemed interesting however whenever I sent my people to go and do anything I would have constant pathing issues. The people would run back and forth on the spot which meant that it took much longer for me to do anything as my people wouldn't respond. The worst case of this was in a battle, I tried getting them into towers however they just kept running back and forth instead of garrisoning the towers leading to me losing most of my defences. Until this bug is fixed it is a definite no go for me even for a dollar as it was unplayable."
