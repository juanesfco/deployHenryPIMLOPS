2016-06-14,22300,True,One of the best games in the olden days. Great storyline combined with good music and thrilling atmosphere really gives you the adventurer kind of vibes. Pros:-Great story-Great classic music tracks-good atmosphere-ModsCons:-Sometimes mysteriously crash-A little glitch here and there. (Bethesda trademarked glitches and bugs)-No sprint button (can be solved with mods tho)Overral i rate this game 8/10 and i recomend this to everyone that likes adventure games in general.
