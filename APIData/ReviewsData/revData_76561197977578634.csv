2016-06-24,264140,True,I love pirates.It was fun until you max out what you can do in the world and everything becomes repetitive.Pro tip: Invest in citrus foods. All other food is useless.
2016-06-24,302510,False,"Basically a badly written Xbox ONE showcase port that basically rips off the Omaha Beach scene from Saving Private Ryan that somehow is set in some make-believe ancient world that can't possibly be planet Earth. Pro:-Graphics is good, but jittery due to it being a console port.-Nice actionCon:-Quick Time Events.-Narrow path-based gameplay. -Most of the game is scripted with cutscenes.-repetitive button mashing.-The writers threw all history books out the window. They did not give a shÎ¹t about accuracy. Just explosions, explosions and more explosions... ...before gunpowder was invented."

2015-11-17,201830,False,"Let me put it this way...The Lego Jurassic World game version is much, much better than this corny piece of crap. As a hardcore fan of the novels and movies, I feel Telltale have horribly ruined the concept of Jurassic Park. I cringed the entire way through this very long cartoon. So disappointed in this game.--> The graphics is like I said, a cartoon.--> The animation is really bad. I mean REALLY bad. It's still VERY glitchy.--> The dinosaurs are portrayed as unrealistically stupid and slow. This goes especially for the raptors and T-rex.--> The writing behind this game is a joke.--> Quick Time Events are the devil. This type of gameplay forces you to become disengaged from the story since you are constantly on edge in case you miss a button press. (If they show, still buggy)The game is basically a cartoon to watch. There's no control. It's entirely QTE. You might as well watch this on YouTube.To save youself some money, watch the game here. It's pretty much the same thing:https://youtu.be/7O7hiJnPHUM"
2015-01-14,72850,True,Love this game. Loved it on Xbox 360 so much I bought it on PC too for the mods.The game was released in 2011. It's still a 10/10 Game.
