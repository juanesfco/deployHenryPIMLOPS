2013-12-29,105600,True,"I don't even Know why i like Terraria...Maybe because it tests my house creativity and focusing your mind to the task and keeping it there can be no easy task in it self. Terraria is very simular to Minecraft...its a 2D game not 3D...Zombies come out at night...simular thing occurs in Minecraft and so on. In Terraria, if u get the special requirements sometimes, you can face off against a boss of some kind....Hint here: The hardest Boss in the game is The Wall Of Flesh which is only found by dropping a Voodoo doll into the lava down in Hell...I Wish you good luck and I hope you can make a better house then me!"
