This game really has stood the test of time; a true testament to the brilliance of the game developers.  If you're into sneaky strategy and tactics and have a bit of patience, this game is certainly for you. Highly recommend =)"

There are some cool downloadables as well. I myself purchased some of the weapons packs to add a few more options to my armoury. In a nutshell, if you are a fan of World War 2 themed games or have in an interest in this particular episode of world history, you will love this game! A++++"
