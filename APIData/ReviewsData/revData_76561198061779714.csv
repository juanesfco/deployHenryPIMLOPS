There is no map, no hitmarkers, no screen-crosshairs, no kill confirmation and it is very VERY easy to get killed. This means instead of 'MLG-l33t' players sprinting all over the map trying to get the best K:D, there is a reliance on teamwork, strategy, wit and most of all caution. If you're looking for a realistic FPS with more stratergy and teamwork, this game is definately for you. "
