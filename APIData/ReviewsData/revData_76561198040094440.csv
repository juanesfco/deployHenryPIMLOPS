Verdun is the first (to my knowledge) multiplayer FPS set in a realistic First World War setting, which is strangly something no one has attempted before. That being said Verdun offer a completely unique original expierence centered around immersion in a WW1 trench warfare environment. Being a bit of a history junkie myself  I found this game hard to resist and it did not disapoint.GAMEPLAY Verdun's gameplay is based (mainly) around team play, providing you and 3 other players with the ability to form one of the different squad types available to each side respectivly."
