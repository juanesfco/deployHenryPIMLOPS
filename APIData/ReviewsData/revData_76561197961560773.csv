2016-04-16,451840,True,This game is really cool. Excellent use of VR third person and first person crossover. Lots of fun.
2016-01-04,290080,False,I played this game for 17 minutes and crashed 5 times. Then I requested a refund. It is a long bow to draw to call this a 'game'. Would not buy in its current state albeit the concept seems reasonable.
