I have also preorderRise of Nations which is very similiar in style meaning game play.  That's another great classic game to own and play.  So if you like Age of Empires, I think you will like Age of Mythology.  Steam you need to bring out Empire Earth Collection as well, this would finalize a fantastic gaming collection for the die hard OleSchool gamers like me during that era for PC."
