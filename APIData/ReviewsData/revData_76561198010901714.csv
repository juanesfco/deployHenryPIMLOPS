2012-06-27,94000,True,"Interesting storyline but not really a game more of a movie (20-25mins), buttons do absolutly nothing to progress the story, audio will continue as scripted regardless if u press a button or not.  Game playthrough footage can be found posted online by others, your better off watching it online than buying this as there is only one ending. However if money or value doesn't concern you then by all means purchase and support the developers."
