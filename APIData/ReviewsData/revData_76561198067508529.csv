2014-11-28,47920,False,"I had high hopes for Shift 2 but NOPE, EA just had to F!CK IT UP! 0/10. The handling is equivalent to driving a f!cken BULLDOZER on a racetrack.. and on top of that, the compatibility is just crap. Crashes every start up. Validating file integrity will NOT help!! ♥♥♥♥ GAME!!!"
