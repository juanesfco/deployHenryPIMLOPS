2016-05-07,209160,True,"Better than how people make it out to be. With that being said - relatively weak storyline, needs more stealth missions. However it is CoD, they have nailed the FPS formula hence why most if not all games since CoD 4 are very similar. Graphics look great (when on Ultra) but you'll need a beefy PC for Riley's Nvidia Hairworks and Antialiasing. I'm running an i7 6700hq with a GTX 970m and 16GB DDR4 rig, on mixed settings between high and maximum i can get 55-60 fps.7/10 buy only when $25 or less."

(Running an i7 6700HQ, GTX 970m, 12GB RAM). Game looks great, audio sounds great. The remaster done is well, but not properly."
