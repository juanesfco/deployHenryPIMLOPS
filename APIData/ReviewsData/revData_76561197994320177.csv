There are four classes to play as, co-op play for two players, a variety of weapons, and useful perks for your marine. The voice acting is excellent- the space marine commander who gives you orders is perfect, and serves to immerse you in the universe thoroughly. It truly feels (in spite of it's arcade style) like the grim darkness of the far future- I will be playing this game a lot in the future. For all 40k fans dissappointed in Games Workshop in recent years: this is a genuine piece of the wonderful and terrible galaxy we've all come to know and love. A single perfectly crafted Space Marine mission. You'll be glad you played it."
