2016-03-28,72850,True,The game is absolutley amazing. With mods you can make this game just amazing. The work that bethesda put into this game is out of this world.
2016-03-26,383870,True,For a walking simulatlor it is very well done. The graphics are very good. The story is so good you don't even realize that you are playing a game. 10/10 would buy again.
