The game at the moment is still undergoing tweaks and all that to make it as best as it can be. There is a lot of history filled into this game, like the legendary battles fought in war of the roses (well this game is called war of the roses so what do you expect) and all that so you will learn a lot about how it was back then when they had battles and sometimes at loading screens they tell you a bit about the map your about to play on.But focusing on the game, the graphics, game play quality and all that is really good, but at times you might run across a bug or too but it rarely happens. The game is fluid and addictive, the fighting takes a little time to get use to but once you get a hang of it you will be just slashing through other people. I would recommend this game to anyone into medieval history and all that or just really competitive people. I give it 8.5/10"

But now for the review, Skrim elder scrolls is a very good game considersing voice acting and graphics although for the acasional bug or 2, I really do love this game and it is a good game to waste a couple of days on i give it a 9/10."
