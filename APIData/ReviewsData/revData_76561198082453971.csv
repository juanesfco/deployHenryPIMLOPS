I saw a zombie in my path and thought i was in the clear. Took the zombie with a swift arrow to the head, searched its body to find a pistol. I was excited for the times ahead, a safer future or even a clearer path. My moment was short lasted. As i was about to put the pistol into my inventory i also was taken by a swift shot to the head by a bandit. I called the bandit a c#nt. He thought it was fair. F#ck you bandit. F#ck you zombie. 10/10"
