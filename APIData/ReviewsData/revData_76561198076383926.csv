2014-04-03,252490,True,Best game ever cool concept quite a contender for DayZ and Nether. When in a server you must be careful who you trust....a good 78% (or so) of players are KOS (Kill On Sight) but every once in a while you run across some nice people to play with.Great building ideas but would like to see mare varryation in what u can build cool durability system BUT EVERYTHING runs out TOO FAST please nerf that Apart from that on e of the best games i have ever played!
