2014-05-09,225600,True,"This game is awesome, it offers a variety of fighting styles with each character and while some are stronger then others it usually comes down to player skill. I highly reccomend this to people to like competitive fighting games or even just hack and slashes with technical play. Get the game because its so unique I can't properly describe it."
