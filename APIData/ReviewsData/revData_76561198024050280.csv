You've never watched anime, except for like, Dragonball or whatever. But that was cool, right? Then you get to high school and you think to yourself, man, all these ♥♥♥♥in weebs. what a bunch of total losers. You leave high school. Life goes to ♥♥♥♥ but you get netflix. You start watching anime on netflix because you've watched literally everything else on there. It dawns on you. You like it. You actually love anime. You feel the transformation. The hunger for superior Japanese content. Words you used to use as a joke, you now use in all seriousness. You start watching hentai. Even the weird tentacle stuff. You realise you've become the weaboo you always made fun of and joked about. You buy Go Go Nippon. The transformation is complete. You're a 22 year old neet with no ♥♥♥♥ing prospects except this game. Well ♥♥♥♥ing played.*5/7 can't wait to play.*at least 80% of this happened to me"
