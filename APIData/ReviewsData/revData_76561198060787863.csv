WOOP! (love you devs for remaking one of my most fav games of all time :D)"

2015-01-16,65980,True,"It's very....Civ V, of course when Civ V was first released it was rubbish, then DLCs were released and it got AWESOME!.now that Civ Beyond Earth has it's first major DLC, it's gotten ALOT BETTER.Conclusion: It's a good game, just remember that no game when it first comes out is 'all that'."
2015-12-11,353830,True,"All im gonna say is this...Gods and Kings is to Civilization V as Rising Tide is to Civilization Beyond Earth, exactly what the game needs (still a but pricey tho, i would wait for a sale before you get it)"

Well if you have, then you will know EXACTLY how fun this game is.You have to infect the WHOLE world and like Pandemic 2 it can be very difficult at first, but as you get into the game then it gets VERY fun watching whole countries fall to a little bug.Overall VERY FUN."
