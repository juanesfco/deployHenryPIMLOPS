2014-02-22,239820,True,THIS GAME IS AWESOME i have been playing it for 3 hours now (according to steam but feels a lot longer than that) and it is really cool i made a bunch of games on it that recieved great reviews and made a bunch of engines in short it is a game u could spend hours on granted it doesn't have a lot of things on there but who cares its fun to play and u shoudl buy it especially since it is 10 dollars on steam
