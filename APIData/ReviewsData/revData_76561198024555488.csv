Also, the implementation of stealth was really well done: simple while still providing a bit of a challenge without becoming frustrating. And of course, you always have the option to just run in blasting your dual-wielded shotguns. Overall 10/10."

2012-07-12,8190,True,This game is insane. So much fun
2011-12-27,57000,True,Really beautiful little platformer. It's quite short but worth it if you can pick it up for $5 or so.
