The controls are relatively simple, left and right to move and either space or x to reverse gravity, but it allowed for surprisingly complex gameplay. The levels were very thoughtfully designed and I always knew how to complete them. Although I have to admit, I almost tried to pull my hair out at certain points in the game (Especially for those seemingly unobtainable trinkets), but I thoroughly enjoyed this game and definitely reccommend it to others (Except if you're prone to rage-quiting, because new keyboards are expensive nowadays!)."
