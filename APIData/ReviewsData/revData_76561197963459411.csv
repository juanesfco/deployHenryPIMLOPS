Just saw Deus Ex and assumed it would be new DLC like The Missing Link.Biggest mistake I've made in a long time. This game was made for for apple ipads and iphones using only touchscreen controls, then ported to pc...badly. I would have thought that the developers would have tweaked the controls and graphics for the modified crystal engine that Human Revolution used. Did they? No - they used the Unity engine that they used for iOS and seem to have paid absolutely no attention to converting touch controls for mouse and keyboard.As a result the game is virtually unplayable and Eidos has shafted many loyal fans for the sake of easy profits.P.S. For once, Twilight is a better love story than this game"
