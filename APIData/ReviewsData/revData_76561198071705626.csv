2016-06-26,286160,True,"Tabletop Simulator is a game where you are on a tabletop, most people use it to play board games, this function is great as you can pick up your enemies pieces and throw  them out of the universe. You can also be a complete troll and throw the table to disrupt the whole game and make the host rewind. This is great and all but clearly the best feature is the virtual tablet. There is a tablet in the game which is fully functional and works great for porn, now you can share all of your porn tastes with your friends! The tablet can be quite buggy but if you stick to pictures then you basically have a multiplayer porn streaming game. Due to this I give the game 9/10, if the dev releases an update which fixes the tablet for compatibility with more sites then I will be able to bump my score up to 10."

2016-09-16,252490,False,Rust may be the worst game of all time. This game is a mix of >insert name of generic survival game here< and the community of a large african tribe in which the members disagree with the others religious beliefs. When you launch the game and see 'alpha 1000' you will understand why this game is terrible.
