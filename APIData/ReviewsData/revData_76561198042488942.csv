2014-12-22,71230,True,This game questions the laws of physics. 10/10.

2014-04-27,221640,True,"This game will make you hate hexagons (and anything to do with lines).Straight off, this game is HARD. You will probably rage a fair bit, but that just somehow motivates you to go on further. You are a triangle that has to dodge six sides of incoming lines using the left and right arrow keys or A and D. You will hear the 'Game Over' voice alot, but just completing a level makes you feel so good. The music is very good, as expected in this genre. I would personally rate this 10/10 because I enjoy playing 'rage-games', and this is a great one at that."

EA shut down the store, which is such a shame because that Jansen hovered at 88 mph. Multiplayer is stil great fun, although not too many people play it anymore so it's best to get a bunch of friends and have a good time. A great classic, a great buy. If you enjoy racing games and for some odd reason never played this, I would definitely recommend it."
