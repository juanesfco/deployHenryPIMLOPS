Scott has really improved on the games, since now he can manage to make the animatronics actually move infront of your eyes. Scotts thing about 'Only one' really worked out, since the older animatronics are now in hallucination form.My main issue with the game is that the jumpscares arent very scary, since most of the time you can see them coming. For example, if you see Phantom BB on the cameras, you know you will be jumpscared. They arent that scary in general too. Another issue is that it dosent really explain the mechanics that well to you, I dont know how to get rid of SpringTrap when he is in your office window/ door.Overall, it is a very good game."
