As a huge fan of DayZ's gameplay model of bare bones, high risk survival, but not a fan of DayZ's infinite development progress despite getting over $60,000,000 in early access sales, this is exactly what DayZ would aspire to be in a beta build or even close to release. The graphics are rich and detailed, the engine handles hit detection very well, crafting is mature, weapons and vehicles behave well and whilst they're rare they're not too rare. Looting is also much more realistic and requires attention to scrounge through piles of things and scanning environments for things that look useful, rather than the DayZ paradigm of opening inventory and walking until ground items show up in 'items nearby'. There's other negative reviews where people say it's crap because they got shot on sight. These types of reviews reflect poorly on the game but they're really other player behaviour. Of course people will shoot you on sight, it's a hostile environment. Perhaps it you don't like the type of game where you need to excercise constant caution you should play a different game that doesn't have guns, or survival, or any form of competition. Sure there's plenty to still sort out, like putting car tyres in your pockets, but this game is miles and miles ahead of DayZ. Get it."
