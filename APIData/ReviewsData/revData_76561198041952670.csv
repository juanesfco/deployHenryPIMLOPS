2014-06-01,230410,True,"I haven't played much of this on PC, most of the time I've put into this was on ps4 (and that's over 250 hours), but anyway, this is probably the best free-to-play game I have played in a long time. There really isn't much else for me to say other than this: try the game out, you just might like it. Besides, its free (and by free, I mean free to the point where anything in the game that isn't cosmetic is obtainable without spending anything but time), so if you don't like it, the only thing you've lost is a few hours of your life."
