2015-11-02,255710,True,"I love to community content for this game, as far as city building games go, I think this is the best current game available, Sim City 5 was a huge flop and was nowhere near as fun to drive as this."

2015-11-02,730,True,I have played CounterStrike since 2001 and I love the fact that the game hasn't changed too much from the originals. I have played CS:GO for a fair while now (1600+ hours) and I don't see myself stopping any time soon.
