It is now my favourite game of recent memory and I cannot wait for the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. If you love adult stories and content, set in a fantasy world where every decision you make can change the politcal aspects and your nearest friends allegiances. Then the Witcher 2 is for you!!!"
2012-12-10,218230,True,"This game!!! Wow!! Yes you do need a beasty PC, but you'll be glad if you already have one cos this game is just so massive! The battles which occur are so intense! and these transport ships called 'Galaxies' are just awesome to see fly around during a huge battle with more than 2000+ people! Per Major Battle! and more than 6000+ on the continent!!! truly awesome! 9/10 it has its weird bugs... and you need a more than a decent PC to run! sorry for those who don't! But when you do... get this game! oh and best thing is... its F2P!!!"
