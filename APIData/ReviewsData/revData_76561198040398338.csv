2016-02-20,244850,False,"I am a big fan of SE and have spent may houres plaing it and have enjoyed it, but within the last 6 to 12 months it has TOTALLY failed to live up to what the developers have said and is unable to play on my high-end computer as it keeps crashing and laggs like all hell and it never give you a reason to why its not working, the only thing it ever gives is a message saying, do you want to tell the developers and I always say yes, but nothing has changed.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND WONT CHANGE MY MIND UNTIL IT IS FIXED"
