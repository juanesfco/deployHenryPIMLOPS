2016-01-14,225540,True,Just Cause 3. The most Anticipated game of whole 2015. When it came out it was a Big Giant Garbage for People. But Luckily Some most of the People could play this on the PC. So if you dont want to have a Big Giant Garbage game that has Crashes and FPS Drops than Just Buy it for the Console Because Just Do it. So Here it is Just Cause 3 Review!!-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=List of Good Stuff> FPS (For Most People)> Controls> Detail> Graphics> Gameplay  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=List of Bad Stuff (For Most People XD)> FPS (Most of the People who couldnt get it to Work Amazingly)> Crashes> Drops> Bugs-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=The Game was a Bit of a Good game for Most People but it also came out Bad for the Others. But if you really want to play this than as I said get the Console Version. but if you dont have a console than well Buy it or Uhh To Bad :( But yea Just Get it for the Console Just Cause. Just Cause its Just Cause 3.
