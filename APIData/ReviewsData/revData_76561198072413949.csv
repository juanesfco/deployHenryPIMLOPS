2014-11-18,221100,True,Okay before I write this I say get this if you DONT mind the really big glitches and bugs that happen in this game. I love it but its super buggy and the lighting engine is broken. They havn't finnished optimising this game properly and I'm quite upset about that. I play this game sometimes when I'm SUPER bored. I do recommend this game if you can push aside all the glitches.
