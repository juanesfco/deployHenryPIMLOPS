2015-04-22,346900,True,I recommend Adventure Capitalist who want to try how capitalism works. It's like that you collect as much money as possible while you're still away. It's a great simulator and I hope in the future that there are more features in this game.10/10 and 5 Stars for this one. Simply Fantastic.
2015-03-05,570,True,"Dota 2 is possibly one of the best game Valve has made based on the original DOTA mod from Warcraft III: Frozen Throne. Many balance changes, including item drops, events, and even cool stuff to collect. You know your heroes well, use them to keep the distinction against your foes and bring their Ancient down, either Raidiant or Dire. I like to play this again and now I do it. I reccommend this to anyone who played Dota before or any RTS/RPG player who wants to take the challenge.10/10 from Neil, Almost 3 Years Steam Veteran"

2014-04-27,730,True,"This is the evolution of Counter-Strike. Very fast-paced, and contains a big selection of old and new guns. New Gun Skins and new features ensure fair gameplay style and customizing your own style. CS:GO is a very great game to get and I would reccommend this to anyone who love to play FPS games a lot."
