2014-08-30,236430,True,Dark souls 1 and 2 are the most interesting games i have played.Its' lore is interesting and its' bosses are cool and its' boss weapons and other weapons are cool as well.I highly recommend this game to people who like souls' games.I like the DLC as well.I look forward to Bloodborne or other souls' game in the future and thanks you for creating Dark souls 2.I hope you make more interesting souls' in the future.
