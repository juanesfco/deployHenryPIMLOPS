2015-12-06,282440,True,This game is a amazing game but the fact i hated about this game is they made it free for a while but you have to buy it now which sucks but i find this game amazing. the weapons in this game are amazing a few from team arena and theres a grapple hook and there is so many maps some taken from other quake games some new and theres new colors of player models the steam workshop for this game has some cool stuff like player models and maps and strafing maps 10/10 i reccomend this game for everyone But its dead now R.I.P
