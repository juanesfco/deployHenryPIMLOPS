2015-02-12,304930,True,Like Minecraft? Like DayZ? Put them together and you have Unturned. It has guns and other weapons. This is when zombie killing gets better and more serious within this game.

The taunts I have is 'The High Five' (not new) 'The Schadenfreude' (not new) 'The Conga' (Added to the game some time ago) and 'The Square Dance' (Added to the game some time ago as well) Anyway, GREAT WORK, VALVE! Good luck people and I will see you on the battlefield."
