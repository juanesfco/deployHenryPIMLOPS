2014-05-05,293010,True,"I LOVE THIS GAME, This game is practically warband and fire and sword but on the sea, the ship menu is pretty hard to learn but fun to learn at the same time, the naval combat could use a bit of work with the cannon system and boarding with some of the troops spawning in the ocean but over all if it had multiplay naval combat where you can board the other play it we awesome"
