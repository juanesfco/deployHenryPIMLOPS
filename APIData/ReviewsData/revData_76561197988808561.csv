The tension felt while playing as the divers is comparable to the excitement of hunting them down as a shark. There's nothing better than tackling an unsuspecting diver out of the room they're defending while his buddies watch on. Or using temwork to take down one of the ocean's greatest predators.The game is pretty well balanced, but as the divers you definitely need teamwork and communication to get the edge over the sharks.There've been numerous updates since release, with the addition of a new game-mode, new sharks, and new equipment, so the developers are certainly keen on keeping this project going from first impressions.If you like PvP games, definitely give this one a go with a few friends."

One of the biggest aspects you need to learn is that the death of your entire party isn't the end, but the chance for a brand new beginning! There's a ton of secrets and extra information to learn through the game (like using Holy Water on a cursed shrine!) that aren't made known, but seem obvious when you figure them out.If you're a fan of 2D dungeoun crawlers, turn based combat, and incredible difficulty, then give this a try."

And after playing the game, I still wouldn't suggest buying the game for $10US.There's plenty of good things about the game, the sound track is amazing, some of the characters are endearing and the boss battles are decently varied and offer a modest challenge.I liked how they tried to do something different with the battles, but outside of the boss battles the bullet hell games aren't fun or exciting after you've encountered them once (and you'll encounter them repeatedly, thanks to the laws of Random Encounters in JRPGs).However the vast majority of the game is simply... vast. Empty space as far as the eye can see.The overworld is plain in the visuals, composed of a TON of black space with nothing to provide any sort of visual stimulation. The 'puzzles', which are touted as a large portion of the game, and are frequently referenced by characters in game, are lackluster, unchallenging, time-wasting and unsatisfying. A few characters are absolutely delightful, but in a game that has about 8 main characters, 3 of them I found endearing, 2 were bland or just tolerable, and 3 were downright annoying.The art style is very inconsistent when it comes to several of the characters. I know this was a game made by several people, but when one character looks detailed and in depth and another looks like they were drawn in MS paint it makes me wonder if these were just placeholder characters who the developers never playtested through and realised they needed to fix, or if it was just laziness on their part.On all I enjoyed the destination, the ending of the game was refreshing, but the journey was a horrible bumpy road along a stretch of empty desert in a car with an annoying dog that pukes once every few minutes.Overall I absolutely adored 30% of this game, and didn't like 70% of the rest. So I'd suggest waiting for 70% off."

2011-08-06,91700,True,"A game that takes a lot of inspiration from Deus Ex. Build your character in a number of ways to take on street shooting punks, facist Federals, opposing factions, and strange mutant creatures from the dark fabrics of the universe. Hop online and co-op with dozens of others to take on the sprawling, open environments and multiple campaign and side missions. Complete your objectives with guns, snipers, ghost-like stealth abilities, hacking the cyberbrains of your enemies and their machines to fight for you, with powerful psy powers, or release a hoard of robots to do your bidding. Still early days and many bugs to iron out, but a wonderfully dark, promising and innovatingly refreshing title with hours of gameplay dripping from its greasy seams."
