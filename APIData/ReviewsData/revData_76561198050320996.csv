Personally, single player mode need some TLC and I mean such cases as dlcs etc where GTA Online has to offer at the moment. Although GTA Online mode is enjoyable, it's only enjoyable if you're playing with a group of mates. If you play alone, be prepared to get randomly attacked out of the blue where you're up against players who are ranked 10x higher than you, which leaves the online environment unbalanced and not wanting to paticipate much. Other than that, great game and many things to do while free roaming."
