However the constant changing view points have resulted in my death in the game quite a bit, nonetheless magnificent scenery and captivatng story. The gameplay was a bit shakey but very wonderful, leaping through the air from beam to beam tends to exite someone, and this game created that feeling.  The addition of the sidescroller prince of persia minigames was excelent.There were a few issues with playing on steam however, I noticed that it lacked the ability to 'shift+tab' while in game. The ability to 'alt+tab' still remains however it is a tedious thing to tab out of a game for the purposes of a message.I did enjoy the soundtracks but there were some moments where it would not play during a fight and then start again at random intervals. Nonetheless this did not make the fighting less intense.In summary a very well made game, it is astonishing to believe it has really been ten years since I have played it on the ps2.I recomend this game for anyone who likes a good story over graphics."
