2015-06-25,208650,True,"Good game, good end to the series.STORY:Pros:- Good story, good escalation, good ending- Actually follows up on Arkham City and Asylum- There are a number of twists and turns in the story, even if someone has spoiled the identity of the Arkham Knight for you, there's still enough awesome twists to make the plot worth playing throughCons:- Because the plot of the story directly follows Asylum and City, it still has a focus on the dead Joker ( which may be disappointing to those expecting that he not be featured very prominently )- The main campaign ( specifically, the 'City of Fear' missions ) has a much better build-up and ending than the 100% secret ending ( which I had to look for comments on YouTube to explain just what the hell I watched )- The identity of the Arkham Knight is way too heavily foreshadowed, in my opinion. You'll probably figure it out before the revealGAMEPLAY:Pros:- All of the Arkham City gameplay you've come to expect returns with a more refined gameplay experience ( Batman feels more powerful than in City )- Fighting Drones with the Batmobile is fun ( when you get used to it )- Fighting the bigger Drones, that require sneaking around, in the Batmobile feels very reminiscent of the Batman predator sections- Riddler Informants ( that need to be interrogated ) are randomly generated as you just run around the place, meaning there's no more 'Crap, I knocked him out - time to run away, come back and try again' from Arkham City- A few new gadgets, in addition to the many that returnCons:- Gathering Riddler trophies that involve the Batmobile can be tedious ( as you switch to Batman, progress the puzzle a bit, switch back to the Batmobile, move it and attach the power cable to something else, switch back to Batman and so on. Also, there are trophies that require following question marks along the ground that are revealed with the Batmobiles sonar-thing. These can be tedious as well as you may need to grapple up a section ( which means jumping out of the Batmobile ), or jump over a section of land, and you're not sure where the next question mark is, or if you've lost the trail and need to go back ) or downright frustrating ( one requires you destroy a bunch of riddler question marks in the Batmobile, but to do so you need to use missiles, or you'll run out of time and need to start the puzzle again. The catch? You need to be in combat to build up the meter to use them, meaning if you screw it up and need more energy to use the missiles, then you need to, tediously, drive around beating up bad-guys cars until you gather the minimum two bars of energy needed to beat the puzzle ). However, they are mercifully few- Not all of the gadgets are acquired via the story, some are literally just laying around, waiting for you to find them ( I'm looking at you, remote electric charge )- A few of the Riddler trophies/riddles actually had me stumped, some riddles required you search around for a little room that exists only to hide the puzzle solution ( which I don't think is entirely fair, but then again, that's just my opinion )TECHNICAL:Pros:- The game does actually run at 25-30 fps averageCons:- You will likely need to turn off a bunch of the fancy graphics options and maybe lower the resolution ( I played it at 1024x768 with none of the fancy options on, and everything set to low. I enjoyed the game immensely, but I also understand not everyone is able to enjoy a game at 25-30 fps with all of the settings turned down/off )OVERALL:Pros:- Good Batman experience- Good ending to the series as a whole ( and, I daresay, a good ending for the Batman mythos )Cons:- There are technical issues; you may want to consider any updates that have been released since this review, as well as what people have been saying on the discussion board, before actually making the purchase"
