2014-08-19,48700,True,This game is ruining my life... My house is a mess I've lost my girlfriend and my friends. I've been skiped all my classes for the last few weeks. I've lost my job and I'll be evicted from my apartment any minute now and I'll have to move back in to my parents basement... However I won't last long there since they plan to send me to Rehab for my addiction to this game... All for this stupid game that I've wasted so much time on...Best game ever 10/10.

2015-08-28,253710,False,The game isn't the worst thing in the world. It's fun but you have to have a licence for literally everything... How do you get those licences? With real world mother ♥♥♥♥ing money! The game wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for all the ♥♥♥♥ing micro transactions! Don't waste your money just find some other game to get.
