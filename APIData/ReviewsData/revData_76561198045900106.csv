Fantastic story with deep and interesting characters, fun combat that is super responsive and never gets boring, loads of upgrades for various attributes of your character and amazing graphical detail all wrapped up in a great PC port that fully utilizes keyboard and mouse controls. The fact that this was created by a single person really makes this a must have."
