2014-01-30,1250,True,a great co-op wave based survival game very fun when playing with friends a great variety of weapons to choose from whether it'd be blowing up crap or having a nice clean slice on something or if your a pyromaniac then burning things in this will be a blast for you with 7different perks to choose from and up to 6players to play with at once.
