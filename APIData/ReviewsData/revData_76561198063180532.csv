2015-04-10,252450,True,"As someone who enjoyed playing StarDrive, I'd like to share my experience of playing Stardrive 2. So far (14.6h) I've been playing as Humans (with my own custom civ traits of course - they make a MAJOR difference in your gameplay experience) on Normal difficulty, huge system with 9 other civs, and I'm currently faced with enemies on both my northern and southern space borders. I'm also becoming quite chummy with some samurai space bears. Now I've seen some complaints about Stardrive 2, and I have to admit my first few hours had a couple of complaints - mainly research and... well, I'll tell you what else when I get to it. Further into the game I found out how they downgraded the spy system, but let's get back to research. I was annoyed at how you could not research all the tech on the same tier, and then I encountered my first race. (I'd like to mention that I don't go exploring the entire galaxy, so I don't encounter multiple races before I'm ready to deal with them. That'd just be STUPID... Hmm was that too rude of me?) When I entered diplomacy with them, I was happily surprised to find out that you could trade the tech they had researched for whatever you feel like giving them. After encountering a few more civs, and by the time I met up with my favorite bear shogunate, I realized that unless you take diplomatic action towards these aliens, they're gonna wonder why they should keep the stupid foriegners around rather than kill and conquer them.I should probably mention that being able to customize your ships relatively freely is a big plus for me. They made it a touch simpler than the original StarDrive, but while it was disappointing at first - I realized it cut down the time I spent designing my failures and designing new ships to replace the failures (since they sucked in combat) or redesigning my redundant ships (due to new tech). For example, in SD1 you could face all your weapon firing arcs forward. In SD2, the location of your weapon decides where it aims (except cannons/mass drivers - they always aim forward) The way around this though is to select the *arc extend* feature on the turrets you mount so they cover a 180* angle - aka they can fire forward. I'll be updating this review in a few days once I'm back home and play a bit more, so I'll leave you with this: if you like customization and you find that you can understand a game's mechanics fairly quickly, then you'll enjoy this game."

2015-07-22,368160,True,"[Just a comment - not a review] Loved it! But... CLIFFHANGER WHY U DO DIS!?!? ERMARGERD! I'm going to desperately wait for the translation of episode.03, at least until something else I'm hyped for is released."
2015-09-23,322910,False,"I bought it because I thought it'd be fun to play for a few hours, but it just isn't interesting enough for me to feel value for money. It isn't different enough from chess for it to feel unique to me. If you're interested in the custom executes and a unique twist to chess, then buy this. If you're expecting to enjoy this just because you like other Warhammer 40k games then don't buy this."
2015-09-15,344770,True,"Assuming you're checking out fm2:a because you've read and enjoyed fm1; I can happily tell you that it's well worth the price. It's perfectly executed to hit you right in the feels.The only 'negative' I can think of is that Mil seems a little too educated (although you can explain that away via the literal facebook) and tbh, it doesn't change how effectively this story conveys the messages within.Note to DevsI had the demo installed before buying and installing the full game, and I happened to come across a number of bugs during the part of the game the demo covered. I have a feeling that installing the game while having the demo installed may have caused the bugs since I didn't notice any bugs after the demo covered part. The bugs were limited to; already said lines being repeated without reason in the middle of a conversation - some lines being said by the wrong character - a single case of a repeat of the previous line instead of the correct line. Those were all the issues I noticed. Also, these issues may have nothing to do with having the demo installed; that idea is purely my assumption. Thank you for the VN! I look forward to future updates!Edit: Issue has been patched. Thanks devs!"
2015-06-16,286260,True,"If you're looking for a good story that leaves a lasting impact on you, then this is for you.I am glad I bought and enjoyed this VN - it was a pleasant surprise."
2015-02-23,269250,True,The feels man. Where's book 2? I NEED CLOSURE!!!
2015-02-19,294860,True,"Game is amazing. Completely worth your time. No regrets about going on this ride,"
2015-02-05,262060,True,"This game is so amazing that rather than listing the positives, I'm just going to list the (sorta) negatives;- No art change when upgradeing armor and weapons- Some skills don't gain any bonuses for upgrading (you have to upgrade twice to get a bonus instead)Uhh... That's all the negatives I can think of... Well, since none of these are game breaking issues: if you're interested in this game you should buy it. You will not regret anything except spending too much time playing it and losing the character you named after yourself in the tutorial mission because you tried to be smart and lost instead."
2014-10-09,313730,True,"My Captain Shield was emotionally unstable yet I found myself with a satisfying ending. GG WM (Well Made). 5/5^ and that is the tl;dr of my review.Combat (Captain Mode) 5/5Captain mode is the Normal mode for this game. Out of 2 playthroughs (twice thru the 1st arc, and once thru the second arc), I can say I had no great issues. The last fight in the 1st arc was a fun challenge. Gameplay changes quite a lot depending on your unit investments (you spend cash earnt from scrapping enemies on weapon damage, accuracy, energy usage, HP, EP, and more). I usually set up my ship to fire two rounds of kinetics per turn. In the second arc, there are two battles which will feel impossible (and will be if you don't have the support units for it). The 1st difficult fight (in the second arc) is one of the three side missions. Do the other two first to rack in the cash. Then you can beat this side mission with enough game knowledge. The second hard mission, is just that there are TOO MANY ENEMIES! I mean seriously, TOO MANY ENEMIES JUST TO AMBUSH ONE CARGO SHIP! I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THAT BLOODY SHIP! Honestly though, the combat is fun. There are also 6 difficulty options that you can change in game, so if you get stuck on a mission, you have an easy way out. Or if it's to easy for the master tactician, then you can go be a flippin' space whale.Characters - 4.5/5Potential Waifus are all great. If you aren't happy with any of them, ask for a refun- Oh wait, it's free. Free Waifu is good Waifu.Seriously though, from justice loving, to perverted, to tsundere, to childhood friend, to shy, to patriot, and all the way to 'I only live to fight'; You have a large variety of waifu candidates.Story - 4.5/5*Prologue Spoilers*You're a Captain who's just minding your own business, testing out a prototype ship (welcome to Mass Effect, the VN. Comes with extra waifus), when the USSR invades. Nah, just kidding. It's just a lot of angry people being told that they should be angry at everything, and to vent that anger by shooting space lasers and rail guns at everything that isn't them. So, after a massive capital ship called Legion singlehandedly rips apart your local fleet, it then nukes your capital city. Obviously, you can either die fighting or live to fight another day, so you run for your mfern life. Then you gather allies (waifus) from all over the galaxy to smash the angry peasants that nuked your home. The story is enjoyable though. I enjoyed it.Style - 5/5Style? You have a kick-♥♥♥ ship, space lasers, space whales? Huh? Anyway, you have your own robot-piloting, waifu army. These bad girls have lasers, rockets, rail guns, swords and sidearms. They also disable capital ships, snipe rocket frigates, and download enemy porn collections? Urgh, that stupid pervert. What I'm trying to say is that this game is great.Since it's 100% free, get this awesome game."
