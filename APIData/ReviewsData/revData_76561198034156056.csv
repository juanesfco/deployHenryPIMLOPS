In other words, you are free to do what you want while building up your character to suit your gameplay.In essence this game can be played any way you prefer, but it's best played with a few friends."

2012-07-20,35700,True,"At first I thought this game would turn out to be yet another standard RPG game... The moment I started the game I was immediately proven wrong.This game takes what we love about platformers, puzzlers and RPGs and blends them into a melting pot of awesomeness."
2011-08-17,107100,True,This game has it all; Spellbinding narrative illustrated by amazing hand-painted graphics accompanied by an epic soundtrack. This game is definitely unique and is well worth playing for anyone. 10/10 from me.
2011-07-03,24980,True,"It's quite difficult to describe this game without spoiling too much, however I'll do my best not to reveal any of the story's development.Mass Effect 2 picks up where the previous chapter finished. Your previous actions in the first game will determine the state of the universe in this chapter. While there are many fundamental gameplay changes, Mass Effect 2 is still one of the best FPS/Sci-Fi RPGs to date.Many companions from the first chapter will make a reappearance in Mass Effect 2 depending on your actions in Mass Effect 1, however there are also many new companions, each with a unique background and story which you will be able to explore as the game progresses. Like the prequel, your actions will shape the universe as you progress through the story, and like Mass Effect 1, your actions in this game and the previous will determine the state of the universe in the final part of this trilogy."
2011-07-03,17460,True,"I could write a detailed essay detailing why Mass Effect is so amazing, but I'll just keep it simple. This game is more of a Mixed-Genre RPG than a FPS, but that won't mean FPS fans will dislike this. Inversely, RPG fans won't hate this. Mass Effect provides a deep and immersive storyline where every one of your actions changes the outcome of the game (as well as changing how the sequels play).You will also experience a fair share of Drama, Politics and Religion.In Mass Effect you will also rally companions of several different races each with different backgrounds. These companions each carry a unique unforgettable personality forcing the you to consider their opinions in every action you undertake.In addition, there is a vast and rich universe to discover which will provide you with at LEAST 20 hours of solid gameplay where at the end, you are left with a strong feeling of satisfaction (Not many games nowadays achieve this) and an overwhelming desire to play the sequels."
