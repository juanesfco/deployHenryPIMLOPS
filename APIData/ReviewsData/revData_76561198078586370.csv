2013-12-15,209540,False,"Everything about this game just misses the mark for me.. Graphics, gameplay and the controls in particular. The space combat can be fun however it can get a little tedious and frustrating (for me in particular, being an angry gamer) at times.. All these problems all just combine for an average space combat sim in my opinion. Also the game itself honestly is not good enough to be compared to other games of its genre specifically in ways of visual appeal/graphics, after all isn't space meant to be a 'beautiful enigma'?.. e.g Star Conflict is free to play (although some things must be payed for) however the controls and visuals are far superior than SSZ and for me (Star Conflict) 'destroys' SSZ in the field of which SSZ professes to be the best at: Combat.. Strike Suit Zero has a good story and can be entertaining at points however those are the only positives I can state about this game.. If you are to get this game.. get it on sale.. P.S: This is my opinion don't rage at me if I don't have the same viewpoint as you."
