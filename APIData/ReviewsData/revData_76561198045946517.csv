Game is fun, but randoms aren't fun to play with. Get a group of friends go into a match and pray you don't get somebody who is abusive for little to no reason. It says I recommend, but my opinion is entirely 50/50. There is a TL:DR down below, I'm just going to have a rantThis game has it highs and a lot of lows. The first game of the day you play might be pretty good. You might get on a team that is rather friendly and you have a good match, you play well, everyone says GG and you leave feeling like you really accomplished something no matter if you win or lose. That is the game trying to lull you in a sense of trust and happiness when it decides to throw a massive hardball of a game that'll leave you with more stress than if you ran a marathon while carting a wheel barrow. After that you might do a few things. 1: Retaliate. They might have the right to get SLIGHTLY annoyed, but clearly their reaction is like they have a wasp trapped inside their room and they are freaking out. They're opinion honestly doesn't matter and sometimes even trying to talk to them in a calm matter is utterly futile. I would not reacting and ignore what they say, because all you're doing is adding to your stress. Also when you react, they usually start to feel justified in their actions and start to pile it on. When you react we all lose. Think of those people as Nukes, because once they are set off we are all going down. Mutually Asssured Depression2: Try to redeem yourself in the next game you'll play. It is highly recommended you avoid doing this at all costs. You might want to prove it to yourself, that you can play good. Don't. Clear your head, relax and find something else to pass the time, until you find yourself in a calm mood. Heck, I'm doing it as I write this because I might be the guy who starts yelling at somebody who doesn't deserve it. Instead I'm issuing a warning to all the people who are unfamiliar with MOBA's and want to try them. This goes for all online games actually. Single player games don't yell at you for making 1 mistake. Except Animal Crossing, Mr.Resetti will give a mean scolding if you turn of your game without saving.This is a perfect summary of the experiences I have had playing this fun game with a rather toxic community. Espicially the people who are immediately racist to anybody that speaks another language. Some people should just change their name to Klu Klux Ken or something.TL:DRGame's fun, people suck, I'm an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ too (I just happen to not be vocal about it) and play undertale or something. Play TUG, have a tug; anything to avoid the toxic Dota community and stay happy I guess."

A great RPG with great puzzles, awesome characters and great boss battles. MAN, the boss battles (EPIC!!).  I give this game a          Hoi I'm Temmie / and this is my friend Temmie.Edit: I've only played the Nice guy way and I'm too scared to try the other. Scary  D:"
