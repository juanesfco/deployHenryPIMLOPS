2014-06-29,252490,True,Get this ♥♥♥♥ing game you wretched ♥♥♥♥♥.-Edit: This was my initial thought of the game. Now that they have released the new version of the game I am dissapointed because this was not what I payed for. I wanted a simple survival game that would get your adrenaline pumping. Not a procedural generated map.
