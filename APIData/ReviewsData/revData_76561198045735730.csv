2015-11-12,390670,True,"I love the concept and for the most part, the gameplay but I can tell it's still in beta.Pros:- Large amount of content- Excellent market system as opposed to *cough* wargaming *cough*- built-in Voice and Teamchat- actually USEFUL roles for all classes- Great tutorial systemCons:- It's a beta, and the population is still growing- The steering and camera and scaling needs some work; DDs are too responsive and other classes, not so much- Unreal Engine 3 is past its prime, but it works so I ain't complaining- Devastating secondaries and AA guns. A Houshou I couldn't even spot shot down 6 aircraft before i got them in range- Edit: the Matchmaking is currently a work in progress, t3 and onwards is quite restrictive with tiers, and not many people are playing them either.Other/Speculation:- From looking at the tech tree, the grind seems long, however I am unsure if xp scales to level.Do I recommend this over other games such as WoWS? Yes, it's a unique experience and more arcadey and FUN.I'll edit this review as I progress through the game."
