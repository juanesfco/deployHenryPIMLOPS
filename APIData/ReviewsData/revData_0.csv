2014-11-27,233720,True,The Three things I have learned from Surgeon Simulator:1) You are most likely not to get sued if you leave a scalpel in somebodies stomach at the end of a surgery.2) Ripping someone's heart out during surgery and slapping the patient's face with it is totally legal.3) Intestines make a great scarf.Conclusion: Why the hell not buy this game?
2014-12-09,55230,True,"I am a mature gamer, who tends to stick with mature/dark/serious/realistic games focused on plot and maybe even emotion, and I always like to play as the troubled, complex and dark characters.That ♥♥♥♥ went straight out the window as soon as I brought this game, now my maturity has decreased by 6% upon experiencing the absurdly childish wonders that are mass murdering bad guys with giant dild*os and playing as a toilet.Buy this game and become enlightened. Some say you have not lived until you've seen the seven wonders of the world, I say you have not lived until you've experienced the ridiculousness of Saints Row: The Third."
2016-08-19,22380,True,"I was only 9 years old.I loved Fallout so much, I had all the merchandise and games.I pray to Todd Howard every night before bed, thanking him for the life I’ve been given.'Fallout is love' I say; “Fallout is life”.My dad hears me and calls me a ♥♥♥♥♥♥.I knew he was just jealous of my devotion for Fallout.I called him a ♥♥♥♥.He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep.I’m crying now, and my face hurts.I lay in bed and it’s really cold.Suddenly, a warmth is moving towards me.It’s Vault Boy.I am so happy.He whispers into my ear: “Prepare for total atomic annihilation!”He grabs me with his powerful hands and puts me down onto my hands and knees.I’m ready.I open my vault for Vault Boy.He penetrates my vault.It hurts so much but I do it for Todd Howard.My eyes start to water.I push against his force.I want to please Vault Boy.He roars in a mighty roar as he fills my vault with his vault dwellers.My dad walks in.Vault Boy looks him straight in the eyes and says “Secure your future today, with Vault-Tec!”Vault Boy leaves through my window.It’s not fallout, it’s never fallout.Fallout is love. Fallout is life.(lol i hope nobody actually takes this seriously)"
2015-02-11,313371,True,"Didn't get around to pre-ordering the game back when it was first announced, personally, so I'm glad that they ended up releasing this skin as DLC because I've wanted it for quite some time now. I get where some of the negative reviewers are coming from, about how now that anybody can get this skin it doesn't feel as 'exclusive' anymore, I'd feel the same way, but I thought reviews were about rating a product, not arguing about the fact you don't feel special anymore, which is why I feel as if the 'Mostly Negative' rating for the DLC is not really justified.Moving on to reviewing the DLC itself, I really like this skin. It's stylish, elegant, and badass. The armor is well designed, reminiscent of the elvish culture in the Lord of the Rings films, and the hood/cloak combo truly makes for a classic appearance that rivals the default skin. Even if you don't like the skin, it won't be much of a waste of money considering it is only 99 cents. Personally, I love this skin.Well, this review has become too ♥♥♥♥ing long, so I think I should end it here. I just felt as if I needed to get of my chest to anyone that reads this and is thinking about buying the DLC, that you might want to think twice before taking the Mostly Negative score to heart. In my honest opinion, this skin is worth it."

2016-03-19,33100,True,"Ever wanted to know what it feels like to be swarmed by armies of 700+ giant aliens with miniguns strapped to their backs while you run away screaming like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ with your dual-wield Beretta 92fs pistols?This game will give you that experience.I just had to get this game. I used to play the demo all the time as a 6 year old to 8 year old kid. Oh, the fond memories of playing this game behind my mother's back because she didn't like of all the violence >_>.Well anyway, I am now an adult, and I have returned to Alien Shooter in order to revisit some of my most fond childhood memories... and thank god that this game is still as good as it was back when I first played it.The game's title is pretty straight-forward, and there's not much more to it then that. You're sent into a military complex all by yourself, which has been infested with aliens. Your job is to stop all of the aliens from escaping and going out into the world to wreck havoc, by mass-murdering every single mother-♥♥♥♥ing alien in sight and paint the entire floor and walls with so much blood that the smell would probably be enough to render you unconscious.You start out with your dual-wield pistols, but eventually, you'll unlock a multitude of other weaponry to blow up everything in sight, such as shotguns, miniguns, laser assault rifles, plasma miniguns, rocket launchers, magma guns, and a floating orb buddy who murders everything in sight for you so you don't have to. And I have to say, killing aliens with all of these weapons at your fingertips is surprisingly therapeutic and insanely fun.There are also some minor RPG elements in the game, such as the ability to level up 'skills', the ability to choose your gender, and your name. My favourite part about this game would have to be it's soundtrack. I remember as a kid, upon loading up the game for the first time and hearing the main menu music, it literally sent chills down my spine, and it still does to this day.The only downside to the game I could possibly think of, however, is that the game is very short. I personally finished it in two hours in one sitting, and sadly there is not that much replay value other than survival mode. Overall, the game was very good for it's time, and without a doubt it still holds up today. It is worth your time if you either need something fresh to play, or if you just want to kill some time. If this game is ever on sale, or you have $5 to burn, it is worth a go....or you could just buy Alien Shooter 2."
2015-04-16,250600,True,"This game fascinated and intriqued me, to be honest. It was a nice, meditative, contemplative, unique experience. However, in my opinion, it's more of an 'interactive work of art' then a game. That's the only way I can think of describing The Plan, an interactive work of art.The game didn't make me cry or anything like some other people have been saying (unless they are sarcastic), but it did make me think. When the game was finally over, all I could do was just simply sit there, looking at the screen, not making a sound, because I had no words to describe what I had just experienced. This has been a unique experience for me as a gamer, and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try something a little bit different."
2014-10-27,214560,True,"One of the best Stealth Games I have ever played, and I play a LOT of stealth games. This is also one of the only games I have ever bothered to unlock all Achievements for.  If you’re looking to get into stealth games, I recommend you start out with this one. Mark of the Ninja is 2D, and thus, unlike in a 3D Stealth game, this game is able to show you all the information you need on screen at once, making it easier to plot out your next move. This makes the game great for beginners. Plus, the controls are easy to master.This game also supports Ghost/Traditional Stealth and Aggressive Stealth, as well as providing you with a variety of ways to complete your objective, and thus, the game hardly goes stale. Do you want to sneak past all the enemies, using non-lethal tactics, and leaving no trace that you were ever there in the first place? Or do you want to sneak through the level, stalk your enemies, silently assassinate them from the shadows, and become the ultimate predator and master of your environment? Whatever type of stealth your into, this game let’s you do both. Personally, when it comes to Stealth Games, this one in particular, I am a hybrid of both of those playstyles, and that is what I would recommend.The only issue I really had with this game, was the plot. In my opinion, the plot is rather interesting, and it’s nice and tight. But personally, I felt as if they could’ve done more with the story. However, the ending is exceptional, and very well done. I am not going to mention spoilers, don't worry.Overall, this game is very good and satisfactory. If you’re really into these sorts of games like I am, this is a must own."
