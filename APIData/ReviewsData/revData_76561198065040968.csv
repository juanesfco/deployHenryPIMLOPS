2015-02-19,238240,False,"I was wrong to buy this game, personally, it doesn't reach the expectations for reddigit's comment..Character Customization is terrible, there is barely one natural hair colour..Confusing Controls..Only one 'Tip'..Being a little too powerful from the start..All the tools and weapons look pretty much the same..The fact that you dig materials to become stronger, when you are already pretty strong..Stuck on a single planet or boring-ness..Boring in general."
