2014-09-30,12340,True,"I highly recommend this game to fans of point-and-click adventures like Sam and Max, and Back to the Future. Funny characters, if a little cheesy, and a brilliant collection of humour. However, I found the options to do things different ways a bit of a waste of collecting items, and found that some items remained in the inventory when they had no further use. But, can't complain, I got 13 hours out of it! For the price I paid, that's a bargain.4/5"
2014-06-28,250180,True,This game is incredible brutal for a sidescrolling shooter. I highly recommend it... just be warned there may be some wrist injuries from repetitive button-smashing.
