2015-02-27,323470,True,"You get to make your own DBZ Character! And you can become Vegeta's Apprentice! He acts all indifferent about it but he likes youBut on a more serious note, Xenoverse has pretty cheap combat. its more or less just button mashing. and the servers are constantly down. The boss fights can be really unfair too. but i would still recomend it.7/10"
2014-02-19,202750,True,"While it's not the sequel we all wanted, Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a fun follow up to one of the best games of recent years. a new survival mode add replay value, Something that the previous game lacked. However the story does invovle alot of back tracking. Be prepared to explore the same Hotel/Obseratory/Drive-in movie theatre over and over as the story progresses. Overal Its a fun little distraction while we wait for Alan Wake 2.8.5/10."
