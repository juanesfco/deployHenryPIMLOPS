The gameplay is solid, easy to pick up and pretty hectic. Keeping your cool while being stalked by player controlled sharks is a must. I would recommend playing it with friends, for me the experience was amazing with just one friend tagging along. But don't go on my word alone check out some gameplay videos to see if its for you. I had a blast I'd give it a 8/10"
