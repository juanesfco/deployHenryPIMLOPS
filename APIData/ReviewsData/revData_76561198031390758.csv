2012-01-02,440,True,Team Forteress 2 is a really good game in terms of team play:  Hence the name.It requires skill in certain areas and sometimes requires use of the lone wolf tactic.Overall this is a REALLY fun game.9/10
2012-07-12,48700,True,"Great Game, When you get the Napoleonic Wars DLC this game instantly becomes  a bomb loaded with hours of gameplay. There are Line Battles to attend and Regiments to join. Even the Vanilla game is amazing.10/10"
2012-03-08,15320,True,Very Very realistic WW2 flight sim game. THis is not meant for everybody so if you know that you dont want to read  manuals before flying this isnt for you. You can still have fun without the manuals however via the mission editor and this game has the best dynamic damage of any game.It also has a vast mod community which guarantees endless replayabillty value.9/10
2011-09-25,10500,True,One of the Most Realistic strategy games of all time. This game has everything from large scale battles to skirmishes to massed cavalry assaults. Empire Total war is a must buy along with its successor: Napoleon total war and its predecessors: Medieval and rome total war.
2011-09-07,7830,True,"The Most Realistic WWII RTS Game Ever Made! A Must BuyEDIT: The game's multiplayer has been shut down due to gamespy closing down, however, my review still stands. Still worth it for the singleplayer."
2016-06-25,287390,True,"Beautiful storyline of redemption, superb immersive atmosphere, memorable characters and glorious speeches. Why the hell do you not own this game, stop looking at the reviews and buy it. (Buy 2033 as well, stock up on Doritos and Mountain Dew and play them one after the other)"
