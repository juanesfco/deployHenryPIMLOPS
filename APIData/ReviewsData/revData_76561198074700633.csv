Firstly, graphically speaking, it is a gorgeous looking game and it runs at a consistent 60FPS. The game may look like a Super Mario Galaxy Knockoff, and the developer of this game has admitted to that, but personnally, I didn't think it was a bad choice for level design. Control wise, its easy to move sonic about and being able to home in on multiple enemies with the homing attack is certainly satisfying, but the game does have a hard time teaching you how to use its Parkour feature and the game can feel clunky at times. When you get the hang of it, the parkour can be a welcoming new gameplay feature to the Sonic franchise, and I think they should keep it for potential future Sonic titles. I find it strange that Sonic's natural abilitie to run around is mapped to the right bumper of my controller, does Sonic just not have the natural ability to sprint around naturally anymore? However, I do love the welcoming return of the Spindash, that little baby is still rocking my world, although I do wish it lasted longer that 2 seconds after charging it.Be warned, this game starts off simple and easy for you too grasp the basics of how things work, but slowly and surely, the game with put you to the test. This game will frustrate you if you are not patient enough to endure a lot of trial and error, levels will get harder, crazy gameplay elements will be thrown at you from all directions and you are most likely going to die a lot, so rack up on those lives, because this game is not going to show you any mercy. Also, don't feel surprised if you feel like the games many gameplay elements consist of strange activities, such as guiding fruits to blenders, because believe me, the game will eventually reveal itself to have levels built specifically for experimentation and player feedback.The music is definetly something to behold, wonderfully composed with a lot of great orchestration, rock and occasional heavy metal. Though I do wish Crush 40 or Cash Cash came in to do a song like they've done in the past, I guess their contract with Sonic games is over. :/Now, the one thing I hear people complain about constantly is the story, and yeah, it isn't overly complex or enjoyably silly as say, Sonic Unleashed or Sonic Colours, but with what the game presents us graphically with its simple yet beautiful designed with a simple Sonic must defeat Eggman/ The Deadly Six plot, I didn't feel like I was getting ripped off. The Deadly Six as characters, I don't hate them, they're just not that interesting, although Zazz cracks me up with every line he says.Overall, even though I haven't completed the game, while I find that the game does reek of experimentation and they're are some issues with the controls, I had a fun time with this game. Its is not perfect by any means, and for people who can't get into this based on the level design and the controls, I don't blame you, you probably don't have as much patience with games as much as I do.Approach this game with caution my fellow gamers, if you found this review helpful, I'm happy to have given my thoughts on it. Have fun and have a Good night :)"
