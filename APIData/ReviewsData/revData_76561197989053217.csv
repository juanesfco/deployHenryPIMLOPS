Hopefully with the new user experience finally getting some major TLC this is going to make the whole process much more intuitive. The most striking thing to me, was how little damage the initial set of weapons do, and how few useful mods drop early on, I got through the opening missions on Mercury with others, my experience on these levels aided that, but the step up to Venus was horrendous, the osprey shields made trying to kill anything a chore. I was forced to go back and repeatedly run missions to rank up the mods I had managed to collect.However once you break through and get to Earth, this is when the game truly shines, better mods drop which made the whole game seem more palatable. The graceful movement within game is beautiful, the addition of melee 2.0 has added a whole new dimension to the game, making melee both viable and more importantly fun. It is worth the effort to perservere and to get fully acquainted with the mechanics of the game, it opens up a world of possibilities, the continual development is widening the scope of gameplay with each update. Definitely recommend accruingmajor game time."
