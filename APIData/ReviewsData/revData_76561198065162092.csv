If you have the money buy The Forest, if not blow and get the money, very worth it. 9.7/10 near prefect"

2013-12-27,221100,True,Dayz is awesome game don't get me wrong.But 80% of the people that play it are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.There are no real glitchs or game breaking bugs that I have seen so far.I would however like to see some sort of karma system put in place that stops or atleast makes people think twice about killing people just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.
