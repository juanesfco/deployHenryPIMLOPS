If your not, its still i cool game to drive around and set up the playsets you couldn't afford as a child in game.If you were able to afford play sets as a kid and you still show interest in this at the very least you can support the devs."

2015-06-07,290080,True,"Buying this game now is like buying a concept ship in star citizen, the devs have shown us what they can do with the dx9 release and how that didnt have many bugs, and its just a matter of time before they iron out the bugs completley from dx11. From my experience its extremley hard to join a server properly, so the only reason to buy this game now is to give the devs more resources."
