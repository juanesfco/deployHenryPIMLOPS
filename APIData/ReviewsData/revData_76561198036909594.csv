The reason I dont use word 'content' is simplely because it really doesnt provide many things to do in the game. As I said before, this game will amaze u in the first few hours, after that it starts getting shallow, empty, repetitive and boring. Abanden base looks almost the same, except in different colors. Environment look almost the same as you further explore in to the stars. NPCs and animals in the game gives me the feeling they came from spore, so far I only found 4 different high-intelligence species, there might be more, yet they only serve as a gift machine or shop, which I really wish there could be some short quest from different species. This game is marketed as Exploration of the infinite universe, but I think they kinda failed it, there are infinite stars but they share a little bit too much similarity. There are maybe infinite species, but their existence has no meaningful thing to the game except fill up the emptyness. I havent reach the planet with large city on it or with large alien species population, make me feels like there are surely infinite stars out there, but they are lifeless. Hopefully my furture explore will discover some more civilized planet, but for now I will not recommend this game, I will keep this updated."
