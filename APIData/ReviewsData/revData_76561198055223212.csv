2013-11-30,214950,True,love this game if you are a person how likes strategys this is one of the my personal fav is etw and rtw 2 but this one is still the best ancient era it is lake a mixture of civ 5 and age of empire and the auto resolve make the game soo much better (empire total wars auto resolve wasn't that good) and the greek pack makes every thing better (if you like greeks that is) so i servely remmound (and i would'nt call the grand campain accurate)
