2015-03-14,334070,False,"-Final ReviewHektor is a very disappointing experience for the USD$14.99 that it currently charges. It has a nonsensical story that is neither as sophisticated as it thinks it is, nor as interesting as it tries to be.  Its music and art assets are frequently recycled throughout the entire game. It currently has barely 2 hours of game content, which is encased in a platform that seeks to draw out the experience over 3-4 hours through the use of confusing level design.Then there's the glitches, like being unable to interact with in-game items that are necessary for you to proceed further, causing you to have to reload your game. The worst part, and perhaps the most insulting thing about Hektor, is that it isn't scary at all. Outlast was scary, Alien Isolation was a stressful and harrowing experience. Hektor? Hektor is a complete disgrace to the horror genre of games. Watch any of the lets-plays that are currently on Youtube. Not a single one of them is enthralling, immersive, or in the least bit frightening. Many claim that the game's atmosphere is intensely creepy, and that they would prefer a game like Hektor to one filled with jump scares. Sure, jump scares alone do not make a horror game. Neither do games that are all about the long drawn out creepy atmospheres that eventually amount to nothing. You can only play so much of Hektor before you feel cheated and violated, like the boy who is strung along by a candy man with all the promises of a sweet future, only to end up in the back of a windowless van. No, there is nothing causing that sound that appears to be made by the wheels of hospital beds rolling across the corridor. Its just one of the many sound assets that the game randomly plays every now and then to build up 'atmosphere'. In fact, I haven't seen a single hospital bed move in this game. How about those creaks and groans and that squeaky violin sound you hear as the background music reaches its crescendo? Yup, just more of the same. Sounds with no force of a credible threat behind them. And do you know why there is no hiding in this game? Because there is no need to - the game is a bloody walking simulator. The only threats in Hektor reside in the creatures that you will encounter in this game, and what a disappointment they are.The developers advertise this game as having a horrific monster that tirelessly pursues you. Yes there is only one monster in the game capable of killing you. But the only times you experience being chased by this presence is halfway through the game when you first come across it, and towards the end when the game artificially ramps up its difficulty level by putting the creature in your path. Beyond those two occasions, you almost never encounter the creature, much less get 'pursued' by it. Additionally, it is difficult to be afraid of a monster that has pathing issues. There was one occasion when the monster ran continuously into a box that was in front of me as it tried to get at me. Besides this monster, the game scatters, with no logical rhyme or reason, half naked deathly pale people around the map. These death-camp prisoner of war lookalikes cannot hurt you physically, but are capable of reducing your character's sanity level if you are near them when they scream. The first time you encounter one of these people is a decently shocking experience, but towards the later part of the game, their presence is at best an irritating encounter as the game uses the same audio asset for their screams, and at worst you might end up laughing in their face, especially when you see their ridiculous transition from person into a reddish spectre. Who are these people-like things? What is that monster that chases you? What is the Hektor program? Who are you? Why are you at the facility? How did you come to develop your psychosis? Why do you guzzle antipsychotic medications like M&Ms? You'd probably have a better chance of getting that information from God than this game. In fact, Hektor hardly explains anything properly. The game conveys its tale singularly through badly written journal or diary entries that are randomly distributed throughout the entire level in a humdrum and erratic manner.  Walk into the intelligence room for the first time, pick up a journal entry. Walk into the intelligence room again at a later time, great there are 2 more journal entries to pick up. What the ♥♥♥♥ is this? Shouldn't the intelligence room be empty now given that I have just explored it earlier? The entire attempt feels so lazy, so half-hearted. It destroys any remaining immersion that one might have in the game up to this point. The main story is simplistic. It is also full of boring cliches. How many times can we pretend to be interested in the stories told by the people who eventually develop the 'crazies', or some aggravated form of 'stockholm' syndrome? Leave that for the bad movies, it is their rightful domain. You are supposed to be making a horror game that scares us, unnerves us, that makes the hairs on our skin stand as we uncover the story bit by bit. And this is the best you can come up with? $14.99 is too much money to spend on this utter filth and garbage. $14.99 is too much money to spend to be insulted by the developers, who think they can masquerade this bad cashgrab as a 'psychological horror game'. The only thing that is horrifying about this game is our ridiculously low expectations when it comes to paying for and hyping garbage like this on Steam. If you enjoyed 'Daylight', which is another horror game with procedurally generated levels, you might enjoy Hektor. They are both equally bad. Another option is to skip both games, and simply watch a let's play from one of the better youtubers out there. It will require a considerable amount of good acting skills on the part of the youtuber to beat some life into this dead dog's body.Otherwise, FASTER FASTER... avoid Hektor. You have been warned."
2015-03-02,305620,True,"Innovation is almost always a good thing, especially in the relatively saturated and homogeneous survival genre. Procedurally generated post-apocalyptic worlds, need wood get wood, build block-based houses, form groups with other human players to survive, these are elements that are as overused as the faded tighty whities that I continue to wear to date. And who can forget the zombies.It's. Always. Another. Bloody. Ugly. Zombie.And that is why The Long Dark feels like a drop of pristine water on a wretched pair of lips. Its art-style is bold and deliciously refreshing in a game that is intended to simulate survival in the harsh conditions of the Northern Canadian Wilderness. Its rogue-like elements, such as permanent death and a finite amount of loot in the world, shifts the player's focus from spending hours upon hours developing a character and his or her humble abode, to spending hours upon hours replaying just to beat a previous personal best in terms of the number of in-game days survived. And instead of surviving against zombies, players in The Long Dark are tasked to survive against Mother Nature, which manifests in the form of biting windchills and harrowing blizzards, as well as the wolf denizens that perpetually roam the snowy terrains. The sound design of The Long Dark is also extremely well done. Everything from the crunch of your soles on snow, to the groaning and creaking of wooden floorboards as you scavenge a log cabin for much-needed supplies, to the resounding bellow of your hunting rifle as you fire it at a menacing wolf sounds engaging, immersive, and realistic.Yes, realism is The Long Dark's home address. Being caught outside while there is a windchill can be devastating, but hiding behind rocks sitting in the path of the direction of the wind can provide temporary relief to slow down the onset of freezing. The game's hunger system is also caloric based. Foods that you may loot from the environment have calories similar to their real-life counterparts (albeit scaled up slightly). Since all activities, including sleeping and standing still, burns calories, in order to survive your character has to consume a certain amount of calories each day. In addition, he or she also has to drink at least 2.2litres of water a day to prevent being dehydrated. On the other hand, innovation can be a two-faced ♥♥♥♥♥. If taken too far, it can detract immensely from a game's production values and amount to a gigantic waste of a developer's time. Reinventing a tried-and-tested wheel, or removing core gameplay elements of a particular genre for no apparent logical or worthwhile purpose, are typical examples of taking innovation one step too far. As much as The Long Dark is a unique game that stands well apart from the rest in the survival genre, Hinterland Studio has adopted a couple of gameplay design choices that are difficult to comprehend, and for lack of a better word, paradoxical.The biggest culprit lies in The Long Dark's surprising lack of player interaction with the environment. Besides interacting with the game's various containers that exist in the form of drawers, lockers, cupboards, stoves, starting a fire, and the occasional shooting of a wolf or deer, there is little else that the player can do to change or manipulate the environment. Necessary activities such as the cooking of food, harvesting of meat from an animal's carcass, or the boiling of snow to make potable water, are reduced to dull and meaningless loading bars that signal the progression of an activity. There is no farming, there is no fortifying of a prefabricated house to better ward off the cold or wolves. I could think of a hundred more things that a player, as a survivor in an icy wilderness, would be expected to do to survive better. Sadly, players in The Long Dark are robbed of those options because the game limits the ways in which they can interact meaningfully with their environment. Why this should be so in a survival game is bewildering. It metamorphoses an otherwise open-world survival game, one that should be a suitable platform for the inception of personal survival stories, whether heroic or tragic, into a linear game of repetitive choices.This is not to say that The Long Dark is bereft of player-made choices. In spite of the game's limited player-environment interactivity, players still have a good amount of decisions to make that dictates how well or how long they will survive in The Long Dark. For example, constantly traveling in the open when there is a strong windchill will result in your character burning more calories as he or she freezes, thus requiring you to expend more of your limited food supply each day restoring those lost calories. Similarly, being greedy and attempting to carry all of the loot scavenged from your most recent exploration trip will also result in more calories burnt as your character shoulders the heavier load. Making a second trip on another day to carry the remaining supplies back to your stronghold may be a better strategy. Finding a way to make the most out of your limited supplies is an obsession that will occupy players, especially the compulsive ones, for many hours on end.Nonetheless, the negative effects on the game's longevity as a result of its decision to eschew player interactivity in favor of simplicity and ease of uptake are manifest. Despite The Long Dark currently sporting 3 different maps for players to explore in sandbox mode, the relative constrained size of each map and the finite number of prefabs for players to loot means that each map can support at most 4-5 hours of proper gameplay. Beyond that, the game starts to devolve into a tiresome cycle of hunting for deer or wolf, foraging for wood, cooking meat and boiling water to sustain your character's physical needs, and resting in bed. There is nothing else to do. You cannot build, you cannot farm, all there is left to do is to wait for the inevitable end. A most unfitting conclusion to a game with so much potential.At its current sale price of USD$19.99 on steam, The Long Dark is barely worth a buy. My suggestion is to wait for a sale before spending some of your hard-earned money on this game. The Long Dark will most certainly become a better game with time. On the other hand, you are also unlikely to regret if you choose to invest in this game now. It is one of the most polished and interesting early-access survival game that is currently available on the market. And if you enjoy a rogue-like survival game that challenges you to do better in each successive game that you initiate, The Long Dark is capable of providing an almost endless number of hours of enjoyment. I am therefore giving The Long Dark the thumbs up."
2015-01-30,251570,True,"Survival isn’t about immense power, gluttony, or the ability to safely forage, farm or store an infinite amount of food in your home. Survival is about a constant struggle to stay alive in a dangerous and uncertain environment, where the odds are most certainly stacked against you. And it is this essence which 7 Days to Die captures adequately and beautifully in the beginning, but which eventually diminishes and peters out due to the game’s lack of late-game content.Starting out in 7 Days to Die is hard, very hard. The game is similar to Minecraft, it has no storyline or  tutorial to guide you on what to do next. Instead, you are simply thrown in the middle of the world in your underpants, no tools, only a can of chili, a bottle of water, a bandage, and a torch to your name, and tasked to survive.  Juggling your character's various needs, and managing your daylight time properly are both essential components of a viable survival strategy. And it's what makes 7 Days to Die so compelling and stimulating to play. Because frankly speaking, you never quite have enough at the start. And depending on your luck, that undesirable state may persist for a few more in-game days. The Fun Pimps have rightly, in my opinion, made some of tools that are important, but not strictly necessary to survival in the beginning, difficult to obtain. And herein lies 7 Days to Die’s biggest problem. Because so much of its appeal is derived from putting its players in the seat of a survivor who never quite has enough to eat, drink, and is constantly struggling to stay alive against the odds which the game stacks heavily against them from the getgo, the lack of a forceful impetus to survive in the middle or later portion of a game, as one’s character gains in strength and survivability, ultimately and ironically detracts from that appeal. This weakness speaks more to 7 Days to Die’s apparent lack of late-game content than its heavy reliance on a relatively unsustainable premise such as survivability. At the moment, the game fully expects and encourages you to become stronger, but imposes no additional challenges to test your new-found strength. Zombies stay the same, develop no new capabilities, and although the game attempts to shake things up by throwing massive hordes of zombies at you every 7 in-game days or so, they are easily countered if you properly fortify your stronghold. I fully expect, and have faith, that The Fun Pimps will properly flesh out 7 Days to Die's content. At the moment, 7 Days to Die is still capable of offering its players many hours of deep and complex gameplay. I have only spent 50 hours playing it so far, and I believe I will continue to spend more time exploring, surviving and building in in 7 Days to Die. As an early access game, 7 Days to Die is definitely worth your money."
2015-01-08,233130,False,"Started out strong: funny protagonist, the awesome recoiless submachine gun, big chunky enemies for you to pump your lead into, and last but not least, wang cookies.And then midway through the game, you will find that the game's initial charms start to wear off. The game never deviates from its initial path: the same 'wang' jokes are told time and again, the new jokes err more on the side of cringe-worthy instead of funny. The cool weapons become underpowered as the game starts to pile more and more fatties at you at any single point in time. The level design is dreadfully uninspired and boring. You run from point to point triggering the game's setpieces in order to spawn the various over-used enemies which the game throws at you in every chapter. In between the points, you will almost never find any enemies lurking or patrolling. The katana is the game's saving point, severing limbs and decapitating heads never gets old. However, the hit boxes for the larger sized enemies are a little wonky, so you might find yourself supposedly slashing at the back of the bugger, only to be disappointed that none of the hits registered. Final rating: 4/10"
2015-02-06,239140,True,"At the end of the day, as much as one is inclined to, it is difficult to find fault with a game like Dying Light. Aesthetically, the game is a pleaser. In terms of performance on the PC platform, save for the fps related issues on release week, Dying Light performs respectably even on a mediocre rig. On a high-end rig, Dying Light chugs along at the highest settings with nary a hiccup. As for its gameplay, the action in Dying Light is fast and fluid. Combat is flashy as well as impactful, and killing zombies has never felt more brutally satisfying. The parkour mechanic, which is your character’s main form of locomotion in Dying Light, is also somewhat intuitive, save for a few logical inconsistencies. If your gut tells you that a bridge’s truss is traversable to reach its top, you are unlikely to be wrong. Scaleable aspects of a building are very well-differentiated from those that you can’t interact with. Thus whether it is crisscrossing Harran’s rooftops, or climbing to the top of a clock tower to catch the setting sun, Dying Light’s parkour mechanic makes it both hassle-free and a pleasure to explore its vast and interesting setting. There is no mistake about it, Techland has done an admirable job here: Dying Light is one hell of a game to play, whether alone or in a group. Unfortunately, Dying Light has about as much of a heart or soul as the cold and ruthless GRE boss that your character works for.  I could blame the game’s lack of spirit on its poor storyline, as many other critics have done. I could also blame it on the half-arsed supporting characters that the game seemingly throws at you by the dozen, only to then either arbitrarily kill them off or to leave their relationship with your character hanging by a thread and incomplete. Rather I am going to attribute it to Techland’s failure to make any of the interesting features, that it implements in a seemingly laundry-list like manner, into a mainstream component that properly defines Dying Light and what it stands for. Take the game’s setting in Harran for example. Yes, Harran is a vast and spacious open-world in which players can explore to their hearts’ content. Yes Harran is both beautiful, in a morbid kind of way, and immersive. Yet Techland barely utilizes it to further engage and immerse Dying Light’s players. There is a wafer-thin amount of dynamic events in Harran, which usually exists in the form of survivors fending off zombies, or Rais’ goons sitting idly on top of one of the air-supply crates which the game sporadically generates. Harran also remains the same dreary and worn out place that it was when your character first stumbled into it like the ‘experienced’ secret operative that he is, until the moment you dispose of your main nemesis and complete the game’s main storyline. Converting one of its zone into a safehouse may result in you visually pushing or toppling a couple of shelves or cupboards over, as a form of barricading, but there is otherwise no obvious visual cues that suggest Harran is changing or evolving as a result of your character’s actions. Neither does its inhabitants become better off as you fulfil the usually tedious tasks that they set you out to do. An extreme example is the game’s escort missions, where completing one of them merely returns the relevant NPC that you successfully protected back to his or her starting spot, ready to offer you the same mission again. As a result, playing in Harran can occasionally provide a disconnected experience, one where you realize that nothing your character does ever truly matters. On the other hand, do I think that Dying Light is a game worthy of your money, even at full-price? Yes it is. The game is extremely well-polished and has a good amount of content for you to sink your teeth into. Parkouring your way through the game’s numerous side missions is also an addictive experience. I can’t count the number of occasions where I had originally set out to spend 15 minutes on one of the game’s side mission, only to have those minutes turn into hours as I explore, craft, and decapitate or bash zombie heads in. It’s most unfortunate that Dying Light’s absence of a heart and soul, as a result of Techland’s relative lack of ambition, means that it will remain a game that is a distance aways from being a truly great one. This in itself does not detract from the fact that Dying Light is through and through an entertaining game to play. And entertain you it most certainly will."
