2014-03-29,440,False,"Valve has made a slimy move on tf2, as the ideas start to fade they just COPY and PASTE CS : GO into tf2.  If we WANTED weapon skins...   we would play CS : GO  not TF2.  TF2 used to be an awesome game but now its just a remake of CS : GO, a copy and paste for more profit.  R . I . P     Team Fortress 2."
