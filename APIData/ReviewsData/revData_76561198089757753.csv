2016-08-12,4000,True,"Garry's Mod is one of the oldest games out there on steam. However, it's still one of the most popular and most played games on Steam. Garry's Mod is an endless sandbox game which is a sandbox version of the well and known played game, Half Life 2. This allows the user to interact with many things such as objects, cars, ragdolls, etc. From this, the user is able to create anything, they can build contraptions, boats, vehicles, houses, towers, etc. The possibilities are endless! From my experiences, I have overall spent 3,000+ hours onto this game and I've never gotten bored of it yet, not even a little since not only does Garry's Mod include Sandbox mode, there are many more other modes. Some made by Garry and the rest made by the Garry's Mod Community. In addition, Garry's Mod also includes a workshop which allows people to upload their work of art, new items such as weapons, maps, vehicles, etc. Garry's Mod is mostly made up by the community. Anyways, I highly recommend this game to everybody highly because of the price and the infinite possibilities.And there's the other side. This includes-12 Year Old Admins-Mic Spammers-Hackers I had nothing else to think of :(tAlso, from my old review /Want to kill people? Get Garry's ModWant to roleplay? Get Garry's ModWant to die?
