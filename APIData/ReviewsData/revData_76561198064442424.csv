2016-03-22,280790,True,"The game is fantastic, but of course there is a lot of bugs, some of the bugs are funny some are just weird at times.The story of the game is well use your imagination, you can build anything you want but of course you need to collect the materials you need for the job.But yes the game is fantastic, fun to play with friends so don't miss the adventure from the game!I would give this game 10/10most imortant thing is that, if the steam servers is running slow you can't really use your placed objects because they would do nothing.I would say that if there is possible to upgrade the server's connection i think it would run smooth there is some lag issues but it's not very easy to fix them. So my last thing is yes i would recommend this game to anyone who likes build houses or castle."
