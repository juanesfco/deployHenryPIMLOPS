2014-04-10,241540,True,"State of Decay is an open world zombie apocalypse survival simulation, made by a smaller studio. As such, some gameplay ideas are not as well formed as they could be and some bugs persist despite ongoing updates & support. Perhaps the studio's vision is slightly greater than their grasp, but the support to date has been great and most major issues have been addressed (aside from few niggles).Of note, the simulation aspect means that characters in your group will take the initiative & do things for themselves, however the AI is probably not quite up to scratch in handling some of the micro associated with this clever macro idea. If you just don't like any loss of control at all (even when your machine is off!), then this may annoy you a lot - however is is reasonably unobtrusive and does add a degree of SimGame-like satisfaction; if your community is happy and well supplied then it will tick along nicely (the inverse is also true...), and there are endless opportunities for player agency to influence the community's state (!).The game answers your questions about how Zoey and the team from Left 4 Dead stay so well fed, and where exactly those grenade launchers come from. It is engaging, well thought out and likely to continue to be tweaked and refined.It reminds me of STALKER + L4D + Fallout Tactics, if that helps. Highly recommended."
