2014-07-25,20920,True,"I think that THE WITCHER 2: ASSASSINS OF KINGS is one of the best games out, I personally do not play it because it is to laggy but that just means that the game has AWESOME GRAPHICS. even though you need a good pc to do high, i think it is totally worth it."
2014-07-25,227940,True,"this game is really good. the graphics are average, but i don't mind that, also it is really fun playing with friends and you will have a good laugh- trust me. If you just want to kick back and relax with your mates this is the game for you (and it's free!!!)"
