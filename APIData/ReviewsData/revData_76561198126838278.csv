2016-06-30,286160,True,Best community. Very nice people and are always willing to help. Heaps of workshop items that make almost every table top game possible to play. Even played table top mini golf. Regular people who teach you how to play new games.
2015-11-18,227940,True,Its ok but not great yet. It takes ages to 'rank up' and you only het 5xp for each kill. If you get into a battle that has not started you must wait 2:30min for it to start. The weapons are overpriced.  Its realistic but needs a lot of work. For a f2p game it is ok.
