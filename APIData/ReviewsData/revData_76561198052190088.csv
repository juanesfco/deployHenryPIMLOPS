2015-08-10,227940,True,"Like War? Like FPS's? Like divebombing players with planes? THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. Heroes and Generals is one of the better War FPS games out there. Sure i havent played much of it, but what I have played I enjoyed every second of it. At the moment the game is a bit glitchy but that is to be expected. I suggest giving the game a go (with friends makes the experience even better).And remember keep your memes fresh."
