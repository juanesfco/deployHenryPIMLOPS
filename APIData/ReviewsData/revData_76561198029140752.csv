2014-09-16,39210,False,"Please be aware! Your free game time begins when you create your account, NOT WHEN YOU START PLAYING THE GAME, LIKE NORMAL GAMES!!!!!! I did not know this and so lost my money as far as i'm concerned. Not even gonna bother. All I did was update the game through the launcher. Thanks for nothing Square Enix"
2016-08-21,233290,True,Great story. Worth buying for the ending alone.If you want action this is NOT the game to buy
