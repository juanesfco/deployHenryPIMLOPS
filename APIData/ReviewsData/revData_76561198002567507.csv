Intuitive controls and light puzzle solving play out on a background of intrigue and mystery. Inside's setting and atmosphere is quite different to Limbo which I found refreshing. There also are some new gameplay mechanics introduced which add to the puzzle solving mix.There is some limited replay value, but for many this will be a single play through."
