He just keeps running in a straight line from the midfield to your defence and presses a key called 'Square' key to shoot the ball, oh oups, to score a goal*.Oh I should also mention that the only pros about this game are Konami ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, it's really funny when you're playing a game and suddenly a box appears saying 'connection lost between you and the opponent (void)', this happens at 60% of the times and really gets me so high that I really start to enjoy it, and uh, w.t.f? Why does the transition between menus take 5 gentle seconds? I guess that when this game coders do their job, they are drunk or something, or guess what, it's a free game so let's ♥♥♥♥ off steam users and enjoy those unique moments, fakk you konamiNow i'll happily go spend 23$ on fifa 16, it would always be cheaper than spending my time on pes myclub"
