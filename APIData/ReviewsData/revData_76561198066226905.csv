Dont get me wrong i enjoy the steath game but come on why does the movement through cover seems so jotty and switching is rediculously clunky and a little broken (good broken=OP) and its not like with a full FOV most of things you want to see and can get you alerted is always just out fo sight and gets u into trouble a fair bit plus the feeding mechanic is rediculously long hold timmer for you to feed, half the time you tend to kill the people u are will to feed on and feed in people you want to kill..the shadow power feel amazing but as like the cover it is clunky and restrictive as wellI do enjoy it but not enough to give it a thumbs up and to replay itohh yeah the 2 times save funtion deals a good challenge..  i dont know if it has checkpoints cause I ust could not bear to play it any longer"
