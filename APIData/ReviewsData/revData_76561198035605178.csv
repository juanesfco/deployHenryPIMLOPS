If you want that survival of the fitest feeling I recommend you and at least 3 friends and play the 'hunted' game mode on the 'Barlowe' map and pu the difficulty on 'extreme', this will make zombies stronger   and will allow them to kill you in two hits, also when you shoot all the zombies on the map will go for you and it'll give away your position to the other players trying to kill you so it will make you think more before you shoot, other players can set off your phone by using their own but only when they are close to you. If you follow these steps you'll have a terrifying experience."
