2015-05-23,245130,False,"horrible.bought this game around 1.5-2 years ago. Several engine changes, taking out core features that make this game unique.Dev team clearly don't know what they are doing. Something that takes a normal programmer 2 days to do, takes these blokes 2 months.shameless cash grab, exploiting crowd funding.Scam alert.you have been warned."
2016-01-06,346110,False,"This is an early access review!i am reviewing this because i dont like the direction this game is heading. Making threads in the forums doesnt seem to grab the developers attention.before patch 231 (dino nerf) the game was becoming very stale. patches used to come out once a week, now we are lucky to get one once a month. The patches that do come out, are riddled with bugs and unwanted side effects.Balance is still a problem, even after patch 231. If you are employed and have a life, forget buying this game, Bigger tribes full of unemployed neck beards will greif/raid you during the day when your offline, or at night when your offline.There are bugs that have been in the game since day 1, like falling through the ground and dying, unacceptable. Dinos not harvesting resources, clipping issues, the list goes on.Yes i am aware this is an early access game, and bugs are to be expected, but somethings should be patched immediatly due to the nature of gameplay.there was a time i would recommend this game, hence my hours played, however the direction this game is heading, i cannot.4/10"
2015-03-28,236430,False,"Poured alot of hours into dark souls 1, unfortunatly this game pales in comparison.If your from an oceanic region, forget about pvp, its impossible, it will only frustate you. Phantom hits galore, and 99% of pvp people expoit this with katanas and rapiers.Havent fixed covenants AGAIN, forget any other covenant other than blood bros and sunlight, the rest simply dont work.single player feels disjointed, not much time was spent in level creation, it obvious it was a b team effort.the icing on the cake is they are releasing a better version a year after the orginal release with upgraded graphics and bug fixes, basically everything they promised on the ORIGINAL release.if your looking into getting into the souls series, fotget this one, and go back to dark souls 1. Better pvp, better lore, better level creation. period."

2016-01-12,225640,False,"this has to be the worst game i have ever played in some 20+ years of gaming.i love my rpgs, but this game is the worst. in fact, its so bad, im not gonna bother writing a wall of text as a review.its buggy as hell, like alpha release buggy, the gameplay is boring asf, a ton of fetch quests, broken mechanics like falling into the ground. Its so bad, the community had to patch this game to be even remotley playable, even still its a mess.keep away!!! you have been warned."
2015-05-02,335300,False,"How many times does a company need to get it right?after2 releases and numerous patches its in worse shape than it has ever been.Latency/connection has, for some reason, gotton worse on this release. So again, don't bother with pvp.Covenants are STILL broken, why bother with anything else than blood brothers? the rest are broken and dont work as intended.Durability bug? yup still there.The thing that gripes me the most of all, is the imbalance of items in the game. Some weapons and armor are so profoundly overpowered than other equipment, that it makes no sense to use anything else. Which leads to a dull repetitve game with the same thing over and over again.If you own the vanilla dark souls 2, dont buy this, its a downgrade.keep away from this stinker, nothing to see here."
2016-01-05,242760,True,"Surprised more people are not playing this game?So far, i havent encountered any major bugs, the graphics are pretty good for an alpha. The gameplay keeps you entertained long enough, enemy parties get bigger and bigger. they also seem to respond to how you play (aggressive/passive)has potential to beat out ark in my opinion."
