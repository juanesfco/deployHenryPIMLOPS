2014-07-23,34330,True,The height of Total War glory and creation. Great game and worth your time. Never really got into multiplayer until I found out you could play online campaign (fantasy of mine since the early days of total war)10/10
2014-07-23,203770,True,"Probably the best and most addicting strategy game I've ever played. Similar to Total war (another favourite of mine) but far more similar to a game of thrones style game play than epic battles on the field.  If your into politics, back stabbing, power grabbing and trying to keep together a kingdom against feuding lords this game is for you. 11/10 Must buy!"
