Definitely worth the purchase if you remember sinking many hours and coins/tokens in the arcade machines back in the day. All of the games have been perfectly ported. Even the 'cheap' AI is intact and it's a great sense of achievement when you finally beat all three of the titles. If you've got a friend who's keen for some MK action, then 'get over here', grab your controllers and duke it out!"
2013-07-16,200710,True,"If you're a fan of Diablo 2, you'll be right at home with this fantastic RPG. Good quests, great inventory structure, pets you can send to town with excess loot and more. Speaking of loot, there is a lot - a LOT of loot. Great effects from spells and some interesting skill trees. Unlike the first game, it has multiplayer, so if you've got some friends who you used to play Diablo 2 with, check this game out for some great nostalgia."
2013-07-17,203160,True,"The Uncharted of multiplatforms. I've played most of the Tomb Raiders that have come out over the years, however, none have really grabbed my interest as much as this latest entry in the series. I've recently moved back into PC gaming from consoles, and I've played through Uncharted, which I always was sad that non-PS3/Vita owners couldn't play such a game. Tomb Raider remedies this by providing stand out gameplay, skill/weapon customisation, lots of things to find throughout the environment and a good story to boot. This truely is a great fun game and in some ways, it even out-shines the Uncharted series. It feels very much like a cross between an open world RPG and a third-person action game. The way the game plays out is great too, allowing exploration without just pushing the player through the story. You can always backtrack and find things later on. All of those things aside, this game is beautiful and if you've got a decent graphics card/SLI setup, put on the TresFX and check out the amazing fluidity of Lara's hair (it might sound silly but it really adds to the immersion). If you were a bit 50/50 on the old Tomb Raiders or you really liked the series, this is definitely a great reboot to the franchise, check it out!"
2013-07-16,49520,True,"Borderlands 2 is great fun, especially with friends. After the surprise that was the original Borderlands, Borderlands 2 had a fair bit to live up to and when it came out it had improved on so many elements from the original. From the story, the pace and the environment designs, everything was overhauled and made more fun and more vibrant. If you haven't picked this one up yet, get it now!"
2013-07-15,219150,True,Hotline Miami is awesome. The tunes in it are so amazing and the gameplay is just fantastically hard/old school. Definitely recommend it! If you love old school gameplay and old school bit tunes. You're going to love this. It may be an indie game but don't overlook this gem!
