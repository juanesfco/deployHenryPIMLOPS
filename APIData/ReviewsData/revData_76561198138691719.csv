2015-12-30,252490,True,Great Survival Multiplayer game! tons of things to do.
2015-12-30,252870,True,Cant even complete a mission because an AI or Player ship is always there to stop me from getting back to the mission carrier. 8/10 Very nice concept and the ship battles are intense
2015-12-30,314160,True,Got it while on sale so Im happy. Basically the game is about flying in any country you'd like a bit stupid how you have to pay for a better scenery though but other than that good game.

2015-12-30,4000,True,"Game with no limits, Tons of mods and fun to play"
2015-12-30,242760,True,Great survival game about trying to survive from cannibals and mutants after crashing on a mysterious Island. After a while though the game does get a bit boring for me after finding everything but the updates always make me wanna play this one
2015-12-30,383120,True,"Awsome concept and space survival. In my opinion the game is a little complex but it does have brilliant features like Open world planetary exploration, Flying from one planet to another without a loading screen popping up and many other unique features"
2015-12-30,332310,True,Normally I would hardly play a lego based game but this one is a bit different as it is a sandbox lego game where the limit is your imagination.
