The storyline is good , the lore is imersive , and the gameplay is fun.  I can reccomend this to anyone whos like rpgs or survival games.  The only other (minor) thing that could be annoying to some people is the npc's stand completely still when talking and never break eye contact."

2014-05-01,214950,True,great game. a little hard to ply at first cause of the army limiter but u get used to it and use it to ur advantage later.  Very different play style from previous total war games.  Gives u kinda a fresh start to come up with new ways of dealing with enemies and new ways to balance out ur economy.
