Complete lies from what the author stated in several interviews.The game looks good but has no content. I lost interest in 28hrs.As for discovering new planets etc. It's the same mechanics just with different textures/colors. Basically you just repeat the same thing over and over, even the voice in your head telling you that you need to get your $60 value from this won't be enough to make you keep going round and round.I price this game at $19 or less with the expectation that more would be added."
