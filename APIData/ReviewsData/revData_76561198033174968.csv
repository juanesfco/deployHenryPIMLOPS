2015-12-08,410340,True,"From drone addict to drone addict, LOVE IT!1. Pls fix the pixel shadows ( ez unity fix )2. Drone glitches into walls ( properties of drone and walls )3. When I land on some objects e.g tents, rocks, sometimes I instantly get reset.Other than those 3 fixes and the multiplayer button that is useless, amazing game.Also if your new to drone flying do NOT buy. This game/simulation IS hard and does take alot of getting used to."
