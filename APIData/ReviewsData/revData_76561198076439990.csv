2015-06-04,262060,True,"Never Felt Such Strong Love Hate Emotions for a game. There were many bumpy roads on losing someone important or precious while there were also splendid smooth runs with lucious rewards. WARNING TO PEOPLE BUYING THIS GAME : This game is definitely not easy whatsoever. Though some say it mainly relays on the RNG gods, i still have a crap ton of fun with this game and having to played over 40 hours. ; I'm still FAR from the end game. Highly reccommand this fun dark rouge-like game.Now That This Game has been released, my opinion still stands THOUGH i feel as if after numerous patches the game is way more balanced now and surprisingly, easy. Whether it was the game  settings they implented to adjust to your liking for gameplay such as disabling corspe or preventing heart attack or i just got better at le game after playing it for so long. God damn."
2016-02-06,268500,True,I had to reset the first vital mission right after the tutorial mission 4 times cause apparently it's a must to succeed it. Even though i had played xcom : enemy unknowns so this isn't my absolute first time. :|..... WORTH ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT *RUNS INTO BRICK WALL OVER AND OVER*
