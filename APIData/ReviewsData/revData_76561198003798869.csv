One of the best Wild West first person blazing experiences I have ever had and it sure is hell will be a blast for anyone that have 7-8 hours to spare with a considerate decent pricing of 18 dollars, give the cylinder a spin and let the revolvers go blazing !"
2015-05-13,230410,True,"One of the MMORPGS I am still playing to this day. Though I do not fervently pursue every inch and corner of this particular game. It arguably has proven itself a very difficult game to drop as a result of events and decent action.To speak about this game in more particular detail, you would not discover a game filled to the brinks with story and lore. You are a lone warrior of a long forgotten race under the order and jurisdiction of one particular woman who calls herself Lotus. The tutorial will give you a glimpse of the story until you are given your own ship, where the story boils down to sweet FA because except quests that gives you Warframes and event plot lines, all you would be left doing is finding more Warframes, weapons, blueprints, mods and materials so you can craft them, grind them and use them in your quest of discovering more Warframes, weapons, blueprints, mods and materials. You can also throw your own clan's development progress and the contributions you can make towards a game faction into it as well, adding more time to this particular grindfest.So why would I even recommend this game? Well, because the action doesn't disappoint, though the sweet satisfaction of completing and fully modifying and tricking out your weapons and Warframe of choice is mostly rewarded just by a greater statistical number, the complete and total decimation of your enemies is sure to bring a happy smile on any action genre enthusiasts, with bloodied and pretty gory corpses to boot (optional) as you can be sure you are the one that led to their complete and utter mutilation.The boss battle is usually hit or miss, with bosses that are simply bullet sponges to bosses that requires a little bit more finesse, like bosses that teleports and bosses who only intakes damage in certain areas, Normally, you wouldn't have any gripes with more difficult bosses, but when you are grinding for a specific part for something you want and the random number generator have forsaken you in dropping the loot you desire over and over, I think you would grow to hate such technicalities that serve no other purpose than stopping you from getting that sweet four barreled shotgun.There is currently a total of 23 Warframes available in-game, with harder, better, faster, stronger version of some frames available for grinding already, if there is a particular suit you like, you might just be able to grab a even spiffier version of it. Every suit does indeed come with 4 unique abilities of it's own and is highly customisable in terms of cosmetics and specific combat capabilities and parameters.  Every grindable gear, equipment or companion caps out at level 30, with 8 slots for mods (collectible cards that improve stats or utility in someway) each item total. There's more stuff out there then I would care to mention, but you'd find out if you play it no? Just know it probably means more grinding, better damages and maybe just your own personal pet dog, that and maybe space combat with you in a suit that can fly, but hey, I find that to be more of a gimmick in comparison to me pinning a wave of enemies under one powerful arrow, as their mid sections split, separating their body parts into two halves with their decapitated torsos nailed to the wall, all from just one well placed shot from my bow.You have three slots for weaponries, a primary slot for your power hungry dreams like snipers, assault rifles, shotguns or even bows. A secondary slot for that dual-wielding fantasy of yours, or maybe just having to use something because you ran out of primary ammo, we are talking dual revolvers, pistols, shurikens (ninja stars) and automatic repeaters. Lastly, what's a ninja without a melee weapon? Pick something traditional like a katana, a claymore or a long sword or go ham with electronic whips, wolverine claws and grim reaper scythes.Frankly, none of that will drag you into the game more than a mate and a growing clan that needs your attention because of all the exclusive weaponries in it, game factions because of their unique weapons and cosmetics. But more importantly, the timed events that will give you stronger versions of grindable mods and weapons, you can feel pretty left out with out those stuff, but then there is the free trade market in game that will let you grab those stuff you can't grind for anymore (at least for awhile) for real actual money, because there is always someone selling if you are patient enough.If someone tells you all of the stuff in this game is grindable, that isn't technically true, because there are certain things that haven't seen the light of day ever since a certain time period, you have event mods and weapons that are ungrindable outside of events, originally grindable stuff taking out of the maps they can be obtained from, stuff being retired from the game completely at certain points and if you really care for it, unique cosmetics that are sold in real money bundles.This is why I consider this game to be borderline addictive, you are forced to revisit this game from time to time because the game refuses to let you go with its consistent weapon, Warframe and event updates with stuff being retired, made rarer and exclusive by different varying circumstances.But then, neither will you let go of it completely, because you know that friend of yours is quite keen to see just how much damage that fully customised weapons of yours do and you'd be happy to oblige him.Other things I've neglected to mention:Potentially excellent graphics with a decent computer.Four man cooperation gameplay all around, with specific eight man maps out and some more in development.PVP.Clan Alliances and being able to take certain areas under your jurisdiction while being able to tax those who run missions on it."
