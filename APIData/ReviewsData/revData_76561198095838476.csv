Long running animations such as 'The End of the Line' and 'Live and Let Spy' have been made on SFM. With the workshop full of interesting and useful tools, models and sounds, and assets from Team Fortress 2 and Half-Life 2, this is one program that (if you want to animate, make screenshots, etc.) you shouldn't pass up."
