I try to defeat it without killing it but cannot figure out how, so I figure perhaps there is no choice but to kill during boss battles. I kill the boss and then the game proceeds to make me feel like total garbage for doing so. I proceed to the next room and there stands an evil flower, taunting me and rubbing my murder in my face. Feeling guilty and at a  total loss, I decide to reload my save and try the boss again. This time I figure out how to defeat it without killing it. I feel much better about the outcome this time around and my guilt is relieved... that is... until I go to the next room and talk to the flower again. My jaw dropped, my guilt returned. This game is far less forgiving that I would have ever imagined. At that moment, I suddenly started to realize why this game got such high praise. (I am not going to spoil what the flower says. Try the game and replicate what I just described and then you will really begin to understand how deep this game is).Best 10$ I have ever spent. Oh, and take it from me, for the love of all that is good, make sure that you eventually see a secret area called the 'True Lab' (Not to be confused with the regular lab you will see during every playthrough). Until you see that area, you will never get to fully appreciate this game."

The game is a lot more fun if you can manage to get the less interesting endings first, unfortunately by pure chance, I got all the most interesting endings first meaning each play through was a little less enjoyable (but the game is still overall brilliant). Overall, I found the game can be completed in one day so be sure to buy the game when it is on sale (it is well worth it)."
