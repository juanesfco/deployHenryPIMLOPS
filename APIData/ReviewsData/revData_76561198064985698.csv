I'm really attracted to the oldsorc graphics, eerie plot, the different things you rediscover as you replay chapters you breezed over before.  The real fun side to this game for a veteran is to speedrun it. Some players take 20-100 hours to beat it, others take 21-40 minutes.Out of all the 35 games I own, this ones tops them all. Now... They're waiting for you Gordon... In the test chamburrr."

The realism is perhaps a little behind something like flight simluator x, but the trade off is that this game has military simulation with it which means : Guns, bombs, tanks, tactics, strategy.  And the 1946 theme and music is so awesomely presented. To be honest I only know my stuff when it comes to cessna, f-15, f18 high end planes, but this is a really nice interactive way for me to see how planes evolved.Just make sure when you download this game, TAKE OFF GL GRAPHICS - I nearly facepalmed this game when graphics were spiking out everywhere and cheap... Luckily that's just the default, you can change it to a better one thankfully (forget what its called)."
2015-11-28,362890,False,"I payed 10 dollars for this junk???   I'm furious. The most sloppy crap game I've bought on steam. How many damn boxes and barrels are you going to put in one map by the way? Is it against the law to be a little bit creative and make something fun?  I don't care what excuse the company has, not even if they're a charity. 10 dollars for the occasional  'oh yeah that's different' is BULLcrap.  How can the physics be so off for a source engine game? What excuse does this game have when monsters you just kill start floating off into the horizon??? Even quake 1 doesn't have that probelm!Even when they get off their ♥♥♥ and add the xen chapter, it'll still suck. Half life 2 should be the one that is 10 dollars, and this piece of .... should be free."
2015-11-28,314160,True,"Planes are nice and easy to control even though I use a cruddy 3d extrme pro joystick. The game is a tad dated, but still does what it was made for: Being a damn good accurate/reliable flying simulator.The geography is a little bland, but from what I've seen on youtube, you can change this incredibly, thanks to fsx's scenery management options.You get a very fair amount of planes to choose from, not like other crappy flying sims that give you 2 planes to choose from and charge 10 dollar per plane.  You get around 20-30 planes, varying from holiday trikes to fighter jets. The virtual cockpits are also unique to each plane.The atc system, wheather, flight plan system/design, tutorials, information etc... Are pretty polished. If the new tutorials didn't explain enough for you, they've got another section of tutorials from the older msfs games, which is PLENTY to wet your whistle.10/10."
2015-11-26,224960,False,"Absolutely horrible. Relies on a dos emulator which crashes constantly. I've had to fiddle with my graphics drivers and everything to get this piece of crap to work.  I got excited when I finally got to complete 'Lara's home' without crashing to desktop.  Then I enter the first level and Lara looks up then BANG   a big picture of lara's face comes up and my computer crashes.  The crash also flipped my computers screen upside down, and set it to the lowest resolution.Get a playstation 1 and get the proper thing I say."
2014-04-06,72850,True,"A beautifully designed story coupled with interesting twists and memorable characters. This game is full of lores and wonders, and lets the player choose he's heros talents and reputation (the core of what makes The Elder Scrolls Series epic duh). I've played it rushingly and a.h.d style, and still it equates to at least 200+ hours, and I get easily bored!"
