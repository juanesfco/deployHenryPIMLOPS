2016-08-27,6980,True,"NOTE: I've tried the demo of this game and have played before years ago but isn't registering my hours properly. If you're thinking of pirating the game please DO NOT this is an amazing series.Great game my favourite of the series though fan of the lot (even the more new Thief that not everyone was a fan of but I personally thought it was an interesting modern tweak of the series). This is a great pickup during sales you get alot more hours out if it than you do with most modern Singleplayer games these days.NOTE: If you're having trouble running with any of the modern Operating systems (Win 8.1, 10) look up sneaky upgrade for Thief Deadly Shadows on the MOD Database website 10/10 makes this game playable without crashing and a few nice little tweaks without ruining the overall nostalgia."
2016-06-25,393380,False,"EDIT: 27-6-16Bought game 25% off for summer sale all excited from the hype ages ago when it was getting kickstarted.Went to join the only Aus server upasked in squad comms if my mic was working got a yes then team proceeded to just ignore me from then on because I mentioned Im a new player.So much for all those squad posts about welcoming new players, maybe in US servers its different but the only Aus server wasn't the best experience I had no fun being ignored I dont do rambo rush to the point style, I want team work and I didn't get it.let me reintegrate on the fact that just because im a new player doesn't make it a valid excuse for lack of teamwork. I don't care if the community is 'mean' I've learnt and stuck with insurgency for the longest time, even played a bit of arma so was excited for the Mil Sim experience. My experience might differ from others but this was mine, on the Australian server feel free to troll and downvote I couldn't care less it's the internet it happens everywhere I won't lose sleep lolAt current I can't recommend this game (as cool as the guns and classes felt), I uninstalled & asked for a refund, however I am willing to revist on release through other friends that decide to purchase from Aus and make a decision if I will purchase then, who knows by then there may be more Aus servers to play on and they might have a more team based community."
2015-02-09,303390,True,"Neat little FPS Indie game, but not amazing, it provided me with about 5minutes of entertainment and I was done, doesn't last very long in terms of playability but for $1 at its going price, I did get my moneys worth out of it plus some steam cards to boot,  great value for money. One could even say I had a 'Blast'."
2014-12-31,251570,False,"Edit 12/04/2015 never recieved a ticket, terrible customer service though the networking issues are fixed while I will play it I can not publicy support a game with service the equivilant of the screw up that was archeage.Edit 13/01/2015 Still no response from ticket, at this time I do not recommend this game especially if they cant even acknowledge recieving it and the fact that I my hard work on every server is inaccessible so quickly, uploaded my output file for the errors and my dxdiag for my system specs to help them.*ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW*I don't normally buy early access games because of disasterous outcomes but this I think is an exception, this review was written during alpha 10.4 (scrow down to bottom paragraph if you want it straight to the point).While it has its bugs, I've seen games alot worse at full release, this game has great promise, fingers crossed the finished product reflects not just my expectations but most other 7 Days to Die players.Bugs that stand out: At this time there is a condtradicting issue with EAC (easy anti cheat) and Steam, if one cuts out you get booted from the server after getting a message about unable to find EAC being used, sometimes you get banned for it which makes it impossible to rejoin and get back to the action and have to start all over again on another server, your best option would be to either rent a server or start a private server and/or use hamachi or other vpn to play with your friends (you may need to open your ports).Another bug possibly related to the first just plain tells you the connection failed after a few trys it can sometimes work.The third bug which I run into often on a server i've been on in awhile is one that causes me after being in the server for about a minute it just crashes to the game menu without an error message, so I had to constantly change servers (This still happened on my friends rented server, I'm currently awaiting a reply from a ticket I put in a few days ago).One game mechanic bug sometimes even when your inventory is open but your toolbelt is full splitting a stack out of the camp fire can delete all of the item in question except for one.**All in all though I quite enjoy the game, once this easy cheat stuff has been resolved and the networking issues etc I think I'll be more addicted than now, At this time I do recommend it but only if you are going to either play single player or lan with your mates in house or over vpn."
