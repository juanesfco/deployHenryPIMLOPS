2015-12-16,322170,True,People say games don't teach you anything i learned:-Patience-The definition of 'fail' and 'sucsess'-An excuse to get a new PC-How to time travel into the future (i thought less than 30 mins has passed but it was actually over an hour)
2015-07-19,304050,True,I dont really like this this game while playing by myself but its really nice when you're playing with other people. I'm not really into block games but this one is the best i've played so far. The collectable items and the worlds are pretty nice so overall i think this game is good. But there are some things they could improve like the fact that the game is to easy i already made it to lv10 and got to the last world and now i'm practically a master in this game and i did this in 2 days. And another improvment they should do is expand the backpack. But other than that i think this games pretty good. THANKS FOR READING.

2016-06-03,235460,True,This game is awesome the combat was just crazy awesome but sadly the story was pretty short.
2016-02-01,206500,True,Its a pretty nice game but the DLC's are really not worth it in my oppinion.
2015-11-27,346170,True,I love this game brings back alot of memories and not everyone who plays it are noobs. Theres a large variety of weps and getting all of them is kind of a challenge so are the acheivements they're a little to hard. Well thats me. GET PREMIUM THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!
