This short (sometimes slow) but sweet gallery of creativity, in my eyes is the Portal of story-driven adventure games. Tobuscus rated it his game of the year, i call it a masterpeice. Barring the short play time of this game, if you have the funds don't hesitate to engage with this expieience of a game."
2015-04-25,241930,True,Really entertaining yet short open world game. It has Arkham/ Ac's mechanics of combat but it has this really great mechanic underneath that breings fresh ingenuity to the genre. 4/5 haven't played the dlc :P

2013-05-30,220780,True,"An emotiona rolercoaster ride of a game. Let it's simple puzzle platformer status and lack of 'hyper 3d graphics' not fool you. For the charecter development, soundtrack and overall graphics scheme, ties together to form a sentimental joyride of a game. Memomarble. Play it"
