PLEASE FIX THIS. I'LL BE PATIENT. Now back to the review....Loved playing this game. When I bought this game it had a discount I was so interested in it because it was fun, After my first 2 hours of playing it and a few minutes, I kept experiencing game crashes on this game when I choose a character skin or when I'm playing it. After it crashes, the screen becomes black, then it just said said 'Video Device Removed Or Rest' I saw some forums about this and some other people complaining why is this happening..... StIll the creator of this game still isn't informed or maybe informed about this but not doing anything to fix it, or maybe it's taking too long to fix, some people might just get mad and quit this fun game, Please 'CREATOR' or 'COMPANY' of this game, please fix this immediately or it might just become its downfall. Overall I rate this game 5/10, because it keeps crashing. Please fix this 'CREATOR' or 'COMPANY' of this game."
