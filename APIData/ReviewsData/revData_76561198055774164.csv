2016-06-28,730,True,Now i gota say this no matter how many people say how much more bad this game's communty has gotten over the yearsI see that people are consistenly saying 'russians are fagots hackers everywhere and so on and so forth'I have yet to see a russian this year but I saw ONE last year.
