2015-11-27,263280,False,"Fun to play a few quirks and the worst camera in history, barely able to control, lose foucs, no movement then 720 degree spin, on instantly from back to front, wrong side, stuck down low, the most annoying camera I have ever attempted to play with, a game of frustration all of it's own.So aside from the crap ♥♥♥♥ camera, no bloody chain saw and the tiniest branches being insurmoutable obstacles and no steering guide and really fussy front wheel centering. They cheated on the maps, ramping up fuel consumption and slower speeds, so they could get away with smaller maps.Really still does not work on the camera, branch physics and player foot options and either more realistic branches or a chain saw.  Aside from that allowing for a discount still a moderately fun game, more controllable camera would make a good game, chain saw options a great game.The publisher comes off as a real con artist, trying to cheat the game coders. Updates are slow, mods only partly work, no custom maps without fiddling with the game, tends to crash post update.ONLY BUY ON MAJOR DISCOUNT"
2015-09-07,224600,False,"As an MMO one of the rare cooperative player versus environment shooters. Some semblance of story although a bit jumbled, no solid thread of story with a hodge podge of repeated side missions, ark falls and random events. The environment is smaller than it should be and somewhat congested, with different activities jammed in with each other.Still fun to play in a limited fashion as a cooperative shooter, if you do not try to make any sense of it, forget the story and just do stuff at random and don't worry.One to put in the library and spend nothing on. The only thing that keeps me playing is I spent money on it early, only to find how shallow it is. They tend to nickel and dime, watch out for the packs they do not sell what they imply, items that are sold as account upgrades end up being tied to one character only, inventory space is especially problematic and being an Patron is pretty worthless. Keep your expenditure to a minimum to save disapointment.Added to this are some really lame quests, rather than them making tricky or stealthy or skilled, just enemies you need to shoot a bajillion times, it gets boring pulling the trigger again and again and again on your nerf gun ......Want a better weapon, no problem the very worst legendary weapon system ever, ties the the most ludicrous levelling system level 100 nope try 5000, this as a scam because you leave your best legendary weapons behind or spend real money trying to keep them up with your level and you will not do it with spending cash when it comes to legendary weapons.TRION pretty much suck as a F2P publisher being way to nickle and dimey, driving players away from the game, needing more revenue, become more nickel and dimey, drive more players away, need more revenue become more nickle and dimey etc."
2015-05-20,236390,False,"Reasonable graphics, not bad gameplay, but problems with matchmaking.Can not comment on what it is like to play when you spend big but that has always seemed pretty whacked to me, like paying to cheat as game feature.Match loadings are much quicker now, the catch the more you play for free, the slower they become, much slower and not for the reason you think but because they are stacking you against a team where more and more players will be 1 or 2 tiers higher than you ie you become a target drone, against planes with better armament and better speed and sometimes better maneurverability.Problem with these games having only a PvP format means they can not set up more interesting missions, where NPC take on particular roles. Specific defenses, water crossings, convoys et al.Only PvP limits playability before it becomes too much like hard work especially battle higher tier vehciles all of the time.Had to go with not recommend upon further review because the temptation to uninstall grows the more you play. Definately not worth spending money on until they come up with cooperative play scenarios."
2014-03-19,49520,True,"Borderlands 2 is pretty much Borderlands 1  with new map with some player and enemy changes. Whilst fun it was also a little boring, especially if you play it directly after playing Borderlands which is a better game.What was disappointing was the missing customisable weapons mechanic which was promised prior to release but never delivered (I suppose it will be an extra charge as DLC).Seeing as it only really a map and character addon to Borderland, it might have been better to be able to extend gameplay from Borderlands into Borderlands 2 but the way the converted Borderlands players to be NPCs in Borderlands 2 made that impossible.Overall not much different that Borderlands, simply not as good as they wanted to nickle and dime players with DLC that is obviously content missing from the game, if a lot of the DLC had been in the game rather than charged extra for, the game would be as good as the orginal but honestly if you have Borderlands dont bother with Borderlands 2 as it is not as good. If you don't have Borderlands buy it instead."
2014-03-19,91310,False,"Dead Island whilst promising an interesting game experience unfortunately fails in many areas. A clumsy game movement interface showing a poor console port, jumping his hit or miss, sometimes really far, sometimes short.Enemies that level up with you making levelling up somewhat futile including weapons as you are your enemies are basically keeping pace, I have never come across this before and find it a truly strange idea. Poor visual and game mechanic sync, where certain enemies like thugs reach far more than appearances would indicate and if the visual matched the game mechanic their arms would be dragging along the ground a couple of feet behind them.The idea of extremely weak weapon that wear out at a ridiculous rate and require constant repairs is also pretty annoying, an accepted idea taken way to far.Overall the game comes off as having a rather juvenile sense of humour, making the game more annoying than fun, more of a frustrating struggle than a challenge. A game that you could take years to finish, as you just stop playing rather than putting up with the annoyances and then come back to it months later to continue from the last save before again putting it away prior to finishing it.It's a shame Steam don't offer game refund credits, so you can spend unload games like this and spend it on alternate titles, this game is definitely of money back quality."
