Or making your own zombie survival camp then spawning in zombies and KILLING THEM. You could also download little things that make your game much better. And if your like me and always want to get revenge then you can run over your friends with cars, kill them with props, shoot them, or just close down the sever but then you wouldn't be able to play. You can also play by yourself.                                                                          so all in all 100/100                                                                    (: You will never forget this game :)"
