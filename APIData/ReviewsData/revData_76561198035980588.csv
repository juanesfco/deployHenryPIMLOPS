2014-12-05,730,True,"A brilliant game, perhaps falling just short of its predeccesor only in its aiming system, however this is fully interchangable and customizable by the player. I could write quite a large essay about this game, so I'll leave it short.10/10, absolutely astounding game."
2014-05-28,222900,True,"This game has extreme potential. Once Australian servers are released, and the characters have been balanced, I see this game having a bright future. However, it would seem as though crafting will allow for pay to win... The micro transactions within this game are its only current downfall. I'd reccomend the developer take a good, long hard look at their current monetary scheme, and rehaul it. Something like LoL's purchase system, or maybe like Dota 2's set buying system, chest unlockables and so on.. Regardless, as I said, with proper balancing and a dedicated team, this game could easily become a great moba. 9/10."

The textures are also lacking in some areas, and the ingame menu is terrible. Other than that, not much to gripe about, I enjoyed it. 7/10"

2015-07-01,292030,True,"I literally couldn't write a better review for a game. This game, is by far, the best RPG I've ever played in my entire life, hands down. There really isn't a downside, actually, scratch that, the only downside is that the world is not entirely-open, and I wanted to swim all the way to Skellige and get eaten by some Kraken-Esque beast. Either way, this was a beautiful way to end the trilogy, and I really don't think CD Projekt Red could top this game, but I can't wait to be proven wrong. Bravo. Perfect 10/10. You will not play a better RPG game, to date."
