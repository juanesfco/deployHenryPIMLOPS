2015-08-23,107100,True,"So, I'm gonna just jump right the ♥♥♥♥ in.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bastion is a game centered around the adventures of 'The Kid', one of very few people who survived the 'Calamity', a mass genocide, persay, leaving most people a sickly stone statue of whom they once were.The Kid, who never speaks, nor gives us an official name, heads to the 'Bastion', a small sanctuary in which any survivor is welcomed, in the event of the 'Calamity.' Upon arrival at the Bastion, The Kid sees an elderly man, known to us as 'Rucks'. Now, this beautifully voiced man is the narrator for most of the game, and I argue, someone whom truly makes the game what we all know and love. Logan Cunningham, the voice of Rucks, has made an appearance in another SuperGiant Game that I will be writing a review for shortly.So, after chatting Rucks up for awhile, they decide they need something known as 'Cores', in laymans terms, they are bits of immense power that they will use to power and upgrade the Bastion. From here, The Kid's journey is mostly centered around finding these Cores and using them to power the Bastion, to further one of two purposes..Massive. ♥♥♥♥ing. Spoilers. Ahead.So, the Bastion can offer it's survivors a choice. Do they continue to live as they are, happily in the air with one another, or do they give humanity a second chance, reversing the Calamity's effects. I won't go into great detail involving the plot or my personal choices, as I've much more to cover.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bastion's Soundtrack and Score -- I'm nothing but serious when I say this game's soundtrack is a perfect ten.Bastion's Art-Style - With a somewhat top-down Isometric viewpoint and some of the greatest visual effects I've seen used, Bastion earns my 9/10.Bastion, Plot-Wise - While confusing to someone who has never heard of the game, I give it 9/10, presenting you with several choices that will leave you confused and upset, wondering if you could've changed some things for the  better.And Overall, I give Bastion a 10/10.Bite me."
