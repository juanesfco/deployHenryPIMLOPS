(ahahaha) WELL you see GC was bought a lot more frequently than your crrates. you know why? BECAUSE IT WASNT ♥♥♥♥ING RANDOM.Crate complaint: check.Removal of GC and not refunding what was spent is pure greed you shouldn't do that if you want to get those steaks, chicken, vegetables and fruits. You are just killing a game you could have made billions off of just by adding all this crap no one wants. It could have all been avoided if you actually learn't to READ. have fun trying to under stand this. you dont even look at reviews."
2016-07-23,433340,True,"Slime Rancher is a very happy place to go to when you have nothing to do just buy the game its fun and really nice to explore (if you dont watch many videos first) The slimes are cute, the gameplay is amazing and the music is fantastic.only problem is the very minimal lag with alot of slimes or a bad graphics card thats the only problem with it. No bugs and i mean NO bugs i could go searching or just play the game normally and just find 0 bugs.and slime stacks WHAT MORE COULD YOU NEED?"
