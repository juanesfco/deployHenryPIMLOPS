2015-10-19,319630,True,"Gotta say, Life is Strange is the best story interactive game I have ever played, also some of the toughest decisions in gaming I have ever made. This game deserves an overwhelming positive rating just as it has in this precise moment or even greater. If there might be a sequel in the future or maybe just another succesful game from the creators I would not hesitate to buy it. This game has taught two things: Do not tamper with the past, you will unleash chaos and if you do, fix it until the situation is beneficial to both you and society. Friends always matter.-Let me add something. Chapter 5 has been a dazzle, just great."
