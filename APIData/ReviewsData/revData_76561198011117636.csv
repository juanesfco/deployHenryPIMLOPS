2012-12-06,107800,True,A good bit of fun for anyone looking for something new and unique.
2011-10-20,105600,True,"Really actually a genuinely good game. A lot of depth, fun combat, great world to explore, clever monster mechanics and a continually expanding endgame makes this seemingly basic concept incredibly deep and will give you hours of fun with your friends (if you can figure out how to set up a stable server). The building mechanics are also a lot of fun but pretty consistant and kind of mundane. I would definately recommend this game 8/10."
