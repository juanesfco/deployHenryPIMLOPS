2016-06-10,223100,True,"Okay, First of all-This game is not for those looking to have a pleasent gameplay experience, it is for those who had enjoyed the first homefront story (althugh this isnt a direct sequel.)You must know, this game is clunky as all F*ck. There are random frame rate drops, Vehicle controls are dodgy, Audio sometiems desyncs and slightly repetitve gameplay. (move to an area, capture all points, Start anarchy)However, even through its clear flaws, I'd still say this game is worth giving a shot. But not at full price (unless you're a homefront fan)On to Pros and Cons:Lets start with the cons:-Laggy in some bits-Controls are clunky-Reptitve in some parts-Vehicle controls are terrible-Lack of ambient audio/ ambient soundtrackNow, For the pros+Attempts at an innovative 'On the fly' weapon switching+Has its moments+Take Downs are satisfying+Variety of weapon mods is.....interesting.+RC Car simulator 2016+Freeroam+Story.Now, Some might be thinking, Why the hell did i get this game AND give it a thumbs up if the gameplay was less than optimal?Simple. I loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of the First Homefront, And i really wanted to know about other areas of the same universe (Number one was set in sanfran, 2 is set in Philly). The ending of the game was a little satisfying. But lack of audio made it kind of dull. But, there is no awesome soundtrack in war. So in conclusion:GET THIS GAME IF EITHER:+You are a homefront fan+You're looking for a story based around anarchy and revolution+If you dont mind doing reptitive things (I didnt in the case of this game)+Looking for something to get you motivated to shoot something. DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF:-You want Smooth gameplay-You want Smooth Mechanics-Half-♥♥♥♥♥ soundtrack-Repetitve tasksOn one final note: Guys and Girls, you need to play this game for the STORY, not the actual GAMEPLAY.Happy gaming!"
