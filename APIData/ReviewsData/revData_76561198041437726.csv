2011-10-28,440,True,"My review of Team Fortress 29 classes - Call Centre Boy, U.S. Marine that can go air force, Masked fireman, Flying Demonstration Man, Fat Man, Science Hillbilly, Apple Juice throwing Australian Man, Dentist and a French Secret Agent Business Man. Each class has its own unique ability such as flying, glowing and going transparent.There are so many things you can do in TF2. You can re-program automatic gun as the French Businessman, you can play a trumpet as US marine and can even go shiny as a dentist.Ruined my life - 11/10 - would recommend to friends and family"
