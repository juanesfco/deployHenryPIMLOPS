2015-04-15,440,True,"I like the game, but in my last hours of playing it, the game became stail and and also boring, and the only fun times are when you find raging kids that want to unlock heads. And servers with no VAC are just horrible, hackers on every corner, but i still love the game. I look forward to playing this again when they added new things.9/10"
