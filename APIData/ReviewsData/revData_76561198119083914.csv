2014-08-10,302380,True,"After playing this game for longer than usual for arcades, I decided i should give it a review. This is a really nice game with really nice graphics and very relaxing music. After raging my ♥♥♥ off in Call of Duty cause of the campers and lag, I usually turn to this game. When I only want to play this for a few minutes I see myself spending quite a lot of time playing this. This is a very addicting little game that could be huge one day. This... It is really good for a Free-to-Play game. I don't even know why you are wasting time reading this review. Get it now!"
