Does walking through an endless possibility of doors make you want to curl up and cry with happiness? Well this game kinda gives you the experience. Not fully the heartwarming  door simulator you were probably searching for but that doesn't mean you should pass up on this game! No sir! This game will provide you with an okay to better than okay experience as you prepare to listen to sets of instructions (or not, the game is pretty open box in that way) from a man with a soothing voice. 10/13.5"
