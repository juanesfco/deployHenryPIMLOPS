Simplistic yet challenging, it throws you into the game and tells you to push or defend. After about 2 hours, you know where to go, how to go about it, and what will get you shot, and what will get you kills. It's a game of ordered chaos. Plus, I got a 10 killstreak sniping, using a dead horse as cover. Doesn't get much better than that!"
