2015-03-31,207610,True,Great game and storyline to boot. It is as good as watching the TV show. Telltale are really good at what they do.
2015-03-31,730,True,The closest you will get to literally punching your mate in the face because of some BS kill they got. I am not joking.
2015-03-31,48240,True,"Amazing game though it bares a terrible curse, UPLAY! But it also comes with a free froghurt!"
2014-11-16,70000,False,"Cool concept but poorly implemented. Problems I found is there is no FFA, no cooperative, Dinosaurs are basically limited to zee Germans. Not a good game if you have a small party. If these issues multiplayer issues could be added this would be much better."
2016-06-03,228280,False,"Siege of Dragonspear was the first producted I ever requested a refund for on Steam, luckily my request was successful.It crashes every five minutes, I am not joking. Half the time I fast travelled or entered a building it would crash.I only played about 30 minutes of it before I gave up on it and uninstalled the expanion. Luckily my saved game was salvagable. My initial impressions were:* The UI in SoD is very dark and quite unpleasant. * The game felt very linear.* It did not feel like Baldurs Gate, it felt like a poorly made clone. * The story wasn't drawing me in at all. It felt corny and 'simple'. * The voice acting was very average. * The misc. quests were less than two minutes long.Not recommended."

Attempts to fix this issue through the steam version of TA wasn't possible. I recommend you buy through GoG as that version can be used to run in 4k with a patch.Aside from this issue, TA is an amazing game and one of the best RTS games available.Do not downvote this if you are not running 4K as this does not apply to you and this information is very useful to 4K users to save them time and money."
