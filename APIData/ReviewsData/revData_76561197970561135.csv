2014-01-02,203160,True,"Tomb Raider is great, alot darker a story than I was expecting, she's a real assassin in this game, no choice but to kill the bad guys to survive. The press the right buttons at the right time events can be tedious, but its worth pushiing past them.The cult or whoever they are a butchers, bodies and skeletons everywhere...it really has a horror aspect to it."
