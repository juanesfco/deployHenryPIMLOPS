2015-05-30,105600,True,"Wow.... sooooo much to say about this game. Where to start. well for starters, no matter how many other better games you find on steam, Skyrim, The Witcher Wild hunt ANY OTHER GAME! you will never get as much enjoyment out of them as you will terraria. You will never beat the classics such as minecraft, no matter how many times you tell yourself you dont like it anymore...... but tbh TERRARIA is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing!! you think the producers of minecraft have it hard, OF COURSE THEY DO!! its a 3D game, everythings difficult. even tho Terraria is a 2D game it has so much more content including bosses, weapons, biomes, enemies, items, NPC's, tools, ores and A LOT MORE!!! like srrsly you think or minecraft, then think of everything is has. terraria has it but about 5 times more. ESPECIALLY items, terraria has like..... 50 times more items then minecraft. Minecraft just simply cant compete. with terraria you spawn into a randomly generated world with a shortsword, pickaxe and an axe. You find a tree, chop it down, make a house, make some background walls so enemies cant spawn in there then with the rest of the wood a workbench, some tools to mine better ores to make better weapons, look at wiki or do it yourself. spawn an easy boss and DESTROY!!! it with the AMAZING new weapons you have scavenged and made. collect its drops to save up copper, silver, gold, platnium coins to buy unique items from NPC's such as, awesome weapons and humorous items to make your gameplay even more entertaining. and just when you think its over a meteor lands, you go find its location, (attempt to) mine it without getting killed from burning to death or demolished by meteor heads, use the meteor armor, weapons and tools to go deeper underground to find and mine some gold. once you have the gold you make ingots and gold armor and weapons, get better weapons to go aaaallllllll the way down to the underworld (A.K.A HELL!! XD) to mine some hellstone! make a giant pathway thought the underworld, kill a voodo demon and get a guide doll, drop it in lava and summon the WALL OF FLESH with multiple attempts to kill it you will then basically have a new game.... (killing the wall of flesh unlocked hardmode) harder enemies, new bosses, destroy the demon altars with the hammer the wall of flesh drops, which spawns in new better stronger ores to mine....... ANYWAY i HIGHLY recommend buying this game. HOURS AND HOURS!!!! of fun!! i just.... this game is AMAZING!! please buy this gametell all your friends about this gameget them to buy this gamebuy this game for themWHATEVER you can you NEED this game to end your sad little life and make it a good oneanyway!!! :) Take Care ;)"
