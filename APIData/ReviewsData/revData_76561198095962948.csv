2015-01-06,261640,False,when i first heard about thenew borderlands game i couldn't wait then when i got it i played about 3 hours of it and got bored when i first got borderlands 2 and borderlands 1 I loved it. when i installed borderlands 1 i played from 7 pm to 3 am with out knowing. But the the pre-sequel just didn't seem as interesting as the other games so im not going to waste any money of the pre-sequel and im going to play destiny on my playstation and play borderlands 1 and 2 on pc until the next borderlands game
