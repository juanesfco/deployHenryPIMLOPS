2014-07-08,9460,True,"ok so when you purchase this game the first thing you have to do is go to the nvidia website and download the legacy driver otherwise this game wil come up with a stupid agia physics missing error and WILL NOT LAUNCH and it will drive you mental.I started the game and had a sound hardware error which was stupid. no sound but to be honest the game mechanics allow you to easily play without sound. graphics completely maxed out still seem outdated for a 2009 release. however I have to say that graphics don't make or break a good game. frontlines offers a multiple path choice play style which I am rather a fan of in an fps. its great to be able to choose how you want to get to a target. i thought the health system could do with some improvement. I semed to get hit a hell of a lot yet didnt seem to lose much in the way of health, and I found the constant birage of new spawning enemies somewhat unrealistic. however if you like a tactical run and gun style gameplay with constant enemy attacks to overcome then this is a good game choice.I thought the size of this game was a little on the high end. (above 10gb) but I gues for the age of it and the probable unnecessary programming for the time I cant complain to much. I just wish it had been a bit longer play time for the size.overall, now that I have the sound issue fixed, I found this to be an enjoyable title. Hovever for the age and play, I found the original farcry to be a much better more well thought out game, except for the 2 stupidly annoying boss battles. my oppinion if you want this game get it and you shouldnt regret it, but get the original farcry aswell and note the difference for yourself."
2014-03-24,258180,False,"terrible port over from mobile platform.I already purchased this game on mobile but I expected it would have be customised and better on pc, especially seeing its an FPS. I thought wrong. graphics arent flash. pretty much exactly same as on the cell phone, but looks worse seeing as it on a larger screen. i can forgive the graphics. you cant customise controls. there are alot of clipping errors. the cover system will drive you insane. should be just like HR but theyve tried to tweek it and its failed. in game purchases is always something I hate, especially when its already $10 for a 5 hour game. thats enough of my money for time satisfaction thank you. sound effects dont always work how they should. gun battles should be fun but they are not. it doesnt seem to detect which parts of the body you hit properly if it even has a body part hit system (it should because they had them back in early 90's on N64) I did like the story. its a good story as a prequil to HR. and theres side missions which are fun.my honest oppinion is get it on android device. the controls arent perfect but for the introductory price of 99c at the momment, cant go wrong. avoid his pc port unless they completely overhall it. thanks for reading :)"
2014-03-18,247730,True,"im really sorry to say because this game looked awsome. so much that I purchased it. but i feel it is missing the mark. they say you can access most of the sky scrapers, but thats barely true and even the ones you can have a sad mdk/gta3 feel 2 them. I really dont know why it recomends a quad core 2.4gz cpu because the graphics resemble something from the early 2000's and either their rendering system is doing the crysis thing of rendering things that you cant even see, or something else is amiss, but the few servers i did try were dull and uneventfull. im not doing the narrow view thing and comparing to dayz (because frankly i think state of decay is a better zombie survival game) but i just found nether underwelming. dont get me wrong, I liked some of the texture details. and the mechanism as far as encorouging co-opperative play rather than just killing every1 2 steal their things. thats something that sux about most pvp/pve games. rust as an example, great game and well thought out, but most people will kill you rather than work with you to survive. but i liked the idea in this that you have clear reasons why you should work together. and the safe zones are cool. alot to do in there. I guess what Im trying to say is im underwhelmed at the moment and will have to just check back at a later point when things have been updated a bit more. look forward to future updates"
