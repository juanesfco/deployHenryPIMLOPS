2015-08-28,245130,False,"27/11/2015 editJust read they have run out of funds and put development on hold, possible never to be resume. Pretty disappointing. Part of the risk of supporting an Early Access title I suppose.It looked so promising in the beginning but even with the Unreal 4 engine update, the game isn't really any more playable than it was 2 or 3 years ago when I first bought it.Buy 7 Days to Die instead. It works and is fun as hell.Old review belowDisappointed in the development of this game. It has improved visually in the 2 or so years I've had it, but not really in terms of gameplay. There are more features but it hasn't made it more playable. It has promise but nothing that other zombie survival games don't already deliver.If you are dead keen on it, wait for the final release."
2016-02-29,251570,True,"Provided you like the open world, survival, crafting genre, you should find many hours of enjoyment here.I believe this was the first of the genre I tried back in alpha 7. It was a rough but, totally playable game back then. The developers are evidently very committed to delivering a high quality product as they have continued to improve the game since it was available.I find my enjoyment is multiplied when I can find a friendly server where users return. The coop PVE mode works very well and its great when you have a community developing an area all at once."
