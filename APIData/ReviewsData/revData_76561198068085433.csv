While I enjoyed my time with Grimrock, I would encourage viewing videos or playing a demo before purchase as this game is not for everyone.It appears deceptively easy, which is a great hook to want to keep going. A basic story to jump off from that has you wanting to beat the mountain."

Not to mention, this is a shoddy port of an iPad game (frequently asks you to press the iPad during the game). The story is boring high fantasy garbage with no real substance besides collect the cards. So if all you care about is collecting cards and wastin-err spending money to get them, this is probably right up your alley."
2015-10-17,408740,False,"Hello, IHazMagics here and I wanted to talk about a recent game added to Steam. Pro Gamer Manager. Wherein you take the control of a Pro Gamer wannabe with grand aspirations. What I’m going to talk about is a few reasons you should buy the game, and a few reasons you probably shouldn’t. Please note, I don’t have an affiliation with the developer Millenway Studios, this is all from personal experience from game time I’ve had after release which, as of recording is about a day. There may be some words, or terminology that require understanding of MOBA’s in general, if you don’t have that understanding please, ask me to clarify, and I’d be happy to do so.So first off, the game is reminiscent for those that have played a game dev type game. It’s $9.74 USD currently. The first mark I’d put against the game is there’s not really a steam community as of yet. This isn’t a massive mark against the game as it could grow with time and be something that gets larger. However, there’s a very distinct lack of presence from the development team in the Steam forums. That’s something I’d like to see change.Ok, the premise of the game. I personally play a lot of League, but this game will appeal to you regardless of MOBA, although it’s very clearly marketed towards League players. You start as a casual player and seem to gain fans very quickly, while I accept this is intended, it does feel somewhat strange. Personal preference. Moving on. Minor add, lots of spelling mistakes, but it’s a foreign company, so I’d take that with a grain of salt.The first bug I encountered, is the incredibly lackluster menu. The tablet system that explains parts of the game (does it?) and gives you random announcements seems like an ill thought of overlay that doesn’t add anything and instead clutters the screen (which you can still access the base menu while in).Eventually, you’ll come to researching comfort picks. Which is nice. However, if you research the same champion again, instead of adding extra points into understanding an existing comfort pick, it simply creates another entry for the same champion. On top of that, not only does it create a fresh champion, it doesn’t have the same level of played experience. Which is supremely disappointing.Another bug I’ve encountered is also to do with comfort picks. Once you pick your 6th champion as a comfort pick. Selecting them in any game since, will have you selecting your 5th comfort pick. To experiment, I selected a 7th comfort pick champ, and it still picked the 5th.The options menu is completely barren, by which I mean it doesn’t exist. Want to mute your game? Sorry pal, not gonna happen. You have a very sub standard amount of options when you open the game (restricted to what resolution, whether it’s windowed or not, and what monitor it’s displayed on).After playing more and creating a random e-sports league you lose a lot of your individual identity. So I feel it should be clear whether you’re creating a team to be a part of, or creating a team to be the coach of.Basically, after playing the game, I don’t feel as if I have any agency, or any control over my pro gamer path. I’m just doing things, as I see them and if I have enough research then yep, I’m gonna do that. However, the effects of said research aren’t apparent beyond showing up in a profile and certainly aren’t explained through any tutorial.Which leads me to the last thing. A tutorial… Where is it? This game expects you to understand what’s going on straight from the get go, and if you don’t…. Well it doesn’t actually matter because you’ll still get fans anyway. Any of the choices in game don’t seem to have ANY impact long term, where they really should.As it stands right now, if what I’ve said interests you enough to support the dev team, please do so. If however, what I’ve said has made you consider where you spend your money, I think you are making a smart choice, and when the dev’s decide to make the game both A) true to the experience and B) work, then it will be a good game."
2016-02-06,418070,True,"It has pugs in it 9/10It lost a point because it's a game called Turbo Pug that has cats.A legitimate gripe though, having a cursory day/night cycle is fine, but the saw blades are a similar shade to the background making them pretty hard to see.It's fun, in a 'well I've got a few minutes to spare' kind of way. There are things that need to be fixed, for sure. Just don't expect any depth from this game. Did you watch the trailer on the page? Excellent, you know everything there is to know about this game.Lastly, I love pugs and am biased af."
2015-11-16,363970,True,I clicked on ♥♥♥♥ enough to not need to click on ♥♥♥♥ and let the game play itself 10/10.
2015-01-17,264140,False,I hired a pirate that then did nothing. 10/10 great money sink.
