2016-06-30,17460,True,"My first 'real' RPG and my introduction to the trilogy as a whole. Mass Effect 1 is an excellent game that's aged pretty well, though there are still some hiccups here and there.Pros:-An immersive story where most choices have long-standing consequences. These range from fairly obvious galactic-scale choices to something as seemingly inconsequential as chatting with a particular NPC. While not all of these are terribly important, it really gives a sense of connectivity between games. People don't just forget how you treated them in the past.-The planetary exploration system. While it's unfortunately coupled with the horrible Mako controls (talked about in more detail below), this is one often-derided part of the game that I actually enjoyed. By having a planet in nearly every system that you can get down and explore (rather than just scanning from your ship, as in later games) makes the galaxy seem that much more massive.-The universe itself. Like most Bioware RPGs, the universe of the game is incredibly fleshed out. You'll discover hundreds of 'codex entries', which are little articles which describe how things work in-universe. Everything from spaceship design, to FTL travel, to how certain aliens function is covered at some point or another. This is all optional, of course- you don't *have* to know any of it to play the game, but it really enhances the experience when you can see how much thought went into creating this world.Cons:-The inventory system is... not great. I've seen worse, even in AAA titles, but this one is pretty bad. Your inventory will quickly become cluttered with mostly useless junk, with only a few things worth keeping. This does a good job of fleshing out the world somewhat (most things have a small description or at least a logo, making the galaxy feel bigger), but at the cost of convenience. You practically have to micromanage your squadmate's armor and guns for the first half of the game or so. Once you get access to the really good stuff, everything else becomes pretty much obsolete. Credits become kind of superfulous at the end of the game as well- I maxed out my bank on my first run without even really trying.-The dreaded Mako. It's essentially an armored vehicle for planetary exploration. Sounds great, right? The problem is that the handling is utterly atrocious. The thing lumbers around like a drunken rhinocerous, until it gets stuck on a rock outcropping and flies halfway across the map. It's all right to drive on a flat surface, but most planets are at least somewhat mountainous. There are even a few that are almost nothing but hills. Once again, this adds character to the planets at the expense of gameplay. Everything else:-The combat's nothing special. Not bad, mind you, but it doesn't do a whole lot that's really unique. Third-person shooting from behind chest-high walls with some different powers to liven things up. These range from hacking robotic enemies or weapons to 'biotic' powers which are essentially Force moves. The AI for enemies can get a bit stupid at times with characters running straight into your ambushes. -The graphics are good. A lot of the planetary environments are still beautiful, but some of the characters can get off-model mid-cutscene which makes things pretty jarring. Overall, I'd rate this a solid 9/10. Good combat, if nothing new, coupled with a wonderfully rich environment, engaging characters, and long-lasting consequences that will follow you through the trilogy."
