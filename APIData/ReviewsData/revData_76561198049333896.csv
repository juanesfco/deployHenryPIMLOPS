I haven't played much at all due to the fact that it was simply too hard to gather materials to build shelter etc, now I have a nice little starter place that I am living in and am starting to build fortifications...Note for the devs, Allow us to dive in water please! I chopped down a tree and 2 logs are sitting at the bottom of a lake. I jumped into it and managed to sink enough to be able to grab 1 but there are still 2 down there and its a pain haha.Other than that I have seen so much content added to this game since I purchased it and am looking forward to the next update!!"
2014-08-24,221100,False,"Wow..... I mean I have played games where the controls and lag are bad but this game takes the cake. Everything I have heard about it is a lie.I do not suggest buying this game and waiting through he 5.9gb download just to be let down.... more like thrown to the ground and stomped. For $30 this is certainly theft.The movement mechanics are shot, everything you step on or walk into has the wrong collisions. Finding materials is glitchy as you cannot pick up items most of the time.Communication, well I played 2 servers, used the voice chat and the global typing and no replies what so ever, so either people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s or that isnt working either.YES I UNDERSTAND THE GAME IS ALPHA, but for this much to be going wrong and the game being as old as it is already... I mean WOW!"
