2015-03-11,249380,True,"Firstly, this is based on the 'early access' release of 11/3/15.We all know carmageddon is the apitomy of 'in your face' games, which includes other titles such as manhunt, thrill kill, gta, postal etc.as of the latest update (and theres been a few in the past few months) - although its in 'early access' the game is nicely playable, the game modes and levels are diverse and varied (although players of the original series will find a few familiar haunts).in its current state - the texture optimization / physic's dont quite run as well as they could, but Im confident stainless will continue working on refining their code to run a bit better (this isnt to say - the physics dont work - they do, and are AWESOME) - however in the games current state, the physics and rendering of additional players seems to tax a system quite intensively. if the quality of the final product can be judged off the current state, I'd say we're in for an excellent ride upon final release."
