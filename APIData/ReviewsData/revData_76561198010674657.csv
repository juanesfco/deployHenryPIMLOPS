I never could have imagined this garbage is what you'd spew up from the depths of whatever 'creative' hell it came from. I thought you would learn from what Obsidian did with New Vegas, more depth - more REALISM.The map is smaller than Skyrim, Todd. Not in length, or width, but in the sense that the little things are missing. The special touch and charm that is just on the cusp of every corner you'd turn in the previous fallout titles is missing... The environment feels hollow, too vibrant, too smooth. It's not the same Fallout theme I grew to crave and felt wonder at. You traded something original, something special, from those wonky shooter mechanics to the skill bar and karma system, for what? better FPS mechanics and a more 'console-friendly' interaction system? I would suggest that all digital copies are wiped and the physical copies piled into a garbage dump like Atari did when E.T. the Extra Terrestrial failed... but I digress...This game should serve as a warning to those who find themselves with an IP as significant as the Fallout Universe. It's like they say - 'IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT!' Do yourself a favour and buy Fallout: New Vegas, instead of this $80 squirming feeling of regret and hopelessness."
2016-01-15,440,True,"I spent way too much time on this game early on in highschool, may or may not have led to me dropping math as a subject. Besides that, this game doesn't feel the same as it did 5 years ago. In my personal opinion the new content  scheme they've borrowed from one of their other games, CS:GO, shows a stark indication of how much damage the newer updates have wreaked on the TF2 community. The new guns/skins look awful, it's a transplant from CS gone wrong. It's a lot more toxic, and competitive in TF2 now, F2P destroyed the quality of an already degrading player base. Idle and achievement servers fill up the server list completely. TF2, we had a good run... but now it's time for this grizzled mercenary to hang up his hats."
