2015-09-13,20900,True,"Never really heard of The Witcher until The Witcher 3 and I looked at the trailer for number 3 and I was amazed at what i was seeing and I had decided that until I was to play Witcher 3 that I played the first 2 games and I can say that I was not disappointed in my decision, This game was amazing! the story, the combat system, Geralt's personality, voice acting was dodgy at times but this game really grabbed my attention in a big way."
