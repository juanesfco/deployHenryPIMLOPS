2013-09-05,220,True,"Arguably the greatest single-player fps experience and a true classic complete with memorable characters, story and action packed gameplay set in a immersive dystopian eastern European city with the evil Combine Citadel towering in the middle of it all."
2015-12-31,292030,True,"The Witcher 3 is a true masterpiece and is now my all time favourite RPG. The game has certainly raised the bar for future rpg games in development to aspire to. So much content, great graphics, great story, fun yet challenging gameplay and excellent voice acting. One can get easily lost in the open world environment for it is very immersive with gorgeous scenery worthy of many screenshots. Game of the year for 2015 in my opinion. Well done CD Projekt RedHighly Recommend"
