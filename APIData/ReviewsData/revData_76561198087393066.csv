2014-01-20,209870,True,A great Sci-fi FPS. Controlls are tight and gunplay in on par with most fully priced FPS's if not better. Gun customization is amazing because you are pretty much building your gun from scratch. Pay model in fair in that it doesn't throw BUY NOW in your face all the time but if you want to unlock item perminantly its not cheap but its not unrealistic. Plus Mechs!
