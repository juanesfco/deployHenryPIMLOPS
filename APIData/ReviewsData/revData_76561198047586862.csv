I feel that the player should find a weapon rather easily, to facilitate progress. However, personally I have found I do not find a weapon for a long time, and have to fight off hordes of undead with fists only. This results in usually five deaths, before I finally respawn at NIGHT - and finally locate a weapon. My first suggestion is that the player either starts off with a lower tier weapon at spawn, or that they are common throughout the map - rather than the ubiquitous duct tape one can find. Secondly, I reccomend that the player be able to carry slightly more - I understand what the developer is trying to do here through item choice, but rather than limiting by both weight and item amount, what about just one? It is an interesting system, and not everyone will like the final decision made about it. However, keep in mind these are personal suggestions about the game from personal experience. Again, great game, fun, and requires some intelligence, as well as luck to play."
