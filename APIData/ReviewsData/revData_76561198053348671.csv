The game is an unusual one, it is not a shooter, thats for sure, the crafting is shallow at best. However, as a survival horror, it excels. I have not regretted its purchase at all. Despite a few glitches - nothing major, the game is exceptional. Don't expect to run around shooting etc. There are times of frustration, but as with many games, revisiting areas etc are the key and can fix times where you 'hit the wall'. I recommend this one, get it during the sale. You won't regret it. Oh, and yes it is actually scary."

For the game it serves only to give the game a raison d'etre. Graphically it is stunning. Outstanding in fact. Combat is bizarre i suppose, wave your sword around, kill scary numbers of bad guys, in exotic locations.....including merry old blighty. I did not pay a great deal for this one, that said i have enjoyed the hack and slash. Wierd combos and swordy stuff are cool - remind me of secret of monkey island with the insult throwing 'quit waving your sword like a feather duster'! Sometimes it is hard to follow, it is a generational thing i suppose. its woth a pop, but it one dimensional. Know this if you buy."

Cliche? true. Playable? Very much so. Fun? yep. I struggle to complete games. Many of mine have no limit. I am also terrible for holding attention. But this, i have played through twice ( a big deal considering the time i have) and i currently trying to get 100% of all objects etc. Get this one, it very cheap and super effective. You will not regret it."

2014-03-07,242920,True,"Excellent game, puts me in mind of some of the games i used to play as a boy. Still has some minor frustrations, but it does not make the game any less fun. Best part is the replay value - always something different. Lots of opportunity for expansions and hope for things to come!"

Still better than Leicster in real life. Good fun game for veteans and newbies alike. Some concerns about the game engine, some justified. Though really the only viable football management game out there. Get it, its on discount."
