It's the dialogue and choices that make this game great, plus it really feels like a post-nuclear fallout world would. Get this if you'd like a challenge, nostalgia or to try out what an old school RPG felt like."

Adult-orientated and slower paced than some might prefer, this game might not be for everyone as it's a truer form of an RPG that gamers haven't seen in awhile. The only negatives I can think of is that its a system hog, even with a decent modern comp this game (released 2007) still can run choppy and not as well as you'd like. Apart from that, I can't fault The Witcher - Enhanced Edition at all. Especially at only $20 through Steam. Get onto it."
