2015-01-24,227680,False,I feel stained for ever thinking this game could have potential.
2015-04-17,224540,False,"I played this game a long time ago when it was good. Now it's not good. Nuff said, uninstall."
2015-07-20,314230,True,"IS BROKEN. Looked so good, friends played it and said it was good, then I get one glitch that can't be fixed even after I reinstalled and mow im sad. 10/10 ign would get broken again..."

2016-04-19,374320,True,"Pros-Amazing level design, great graphics, good range of enemies...Cons-But, so many times will attack animations not match up with when they actually hit. You will have a hard time (50% of the time) invading a players world that isn't laggy as hell, many tiny little bugs that are too numerous to list (activley being fixed). You will breeze through a small portion of an area and think that you're doing great when somthing stupid happens (enemy hit you through a wall or a swarm of axe-wielding zombies attacks yoo) and you die... Again and again and again... And again. Neutral-You will die.Conclusion-Not worth the $80 (Australian) I payed, wait for a sale. But a fun game that I will be playing for a while. Don't get this game if you are close to sucide, It WILL push you over the edge."
