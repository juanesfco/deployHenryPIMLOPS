2013-11-26,209160,False,"Its an alright game I guess, its more realistic but the gameplay is bad, the maps arent too good and extinction mode is way too hard. The only good thing about this game is the campaign, its better than all the other cods campaigns.If you want a game just for the campaign and single player, definatly get this but if you want it for the online get black ops 2 or Modern Warefare 3. Personally I'd give it a rating of 4.5/10."
