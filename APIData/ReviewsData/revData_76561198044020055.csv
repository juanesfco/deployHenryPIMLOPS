I could go on about every. little. ♥♥♥♥ing detail about my play through, but you should just play it and make your own stories. By God do I have to hold your hand? Get this game unless you're a whiney, little ♥♥♥♥♥.I give this game a Haggamar/10."

2014-11-06,218620,False,"This game is terrible, i do not recommend it in the slightest.For a game called Pay Day, i didn't get a regular payment from the government. You see I rely on my benefit in order to purchase games on steam and if I am not getting money: No games. This game expected me to think in order to succeed. Do I look like a rocket scientist? ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥ right here in particular. If I wanted to play a game that involves thinking, I would just go back to TF2 and calculate the trajectory of rocket jumping. I'm also highly afraid of clowns so every moment i joined a game I screeched in terror as a team mate came into my vicinity. 1/10."
