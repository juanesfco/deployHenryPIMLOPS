2015-04-05,730,True,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive is what i call 'an upgrade of Call of Duty'. The game handles well with frame drop once in a while. There are some thing which they can improve on like the music and sound effect, just tuning them to fit the game is the biggest down for me.But i remommend this game to anyone who wants to shooting very good handling guns at the other team.Gameplay: 8/10Music and Sound: 6/10Level Design: 7/10Extras (Camos): 10/10Overall: 8/10"
