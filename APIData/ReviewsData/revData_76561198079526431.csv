I love the xray vision that happens when you shoot a guy in the heart, kidneys, liver eye, testicles and so on. This is the best world war 2 game I've played in a while especially since there is sniping. 9/10."
2015-03-07,239140,True,Dying light is unique and different from Dead Island. I highly reccommend playing this on co-op it can be very fun. 10/10 would bash heads again.

2014-02-01,202170,True,"This game is like GTA except it is different. Story is great and you get attached to the characters quite quickly and I love the setting of this game, not many games that occur in China. 9/10"
