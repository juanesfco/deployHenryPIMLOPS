2016-06-30,383230,True,AMAZING! I played it when it first arrived on Indie DB and now it is amazingly updated and has brought some much to the Roguelike Dungeon Crawler RPG Games. 10/10 recommend this game to everyone!!!!
2015-11-09,238960,True,"I would say  this is probably my new favourite game. For anyone who has played Diablo III, you must play this and realize this is better. For anyone who hasn't played Diablo III, play Diablo III then play Path of Exile to then relize that this is so much better. The community and functions in the game is amazing and the skill tree is massive and the classes are outstanding. I love how the skills are in the form of gems and loot and Co-Op in this game is brilliant! 11/10 game!"
