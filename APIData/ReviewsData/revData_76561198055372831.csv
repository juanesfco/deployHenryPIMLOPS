2014-03-01,4000,True,"Ive played this for a while, and this is one of those sandbox games that you can just build whatever and make it destroy everything. If you dont want to build random stuff, you could play Trouble in Terrorist Town, or Prop Hunt,  or watch youtube in a cinema server, or play sledbuild,  or............................ *never ends*"
