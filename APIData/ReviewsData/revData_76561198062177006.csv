The class names are stupid because they are names of people. It is a distant relative in hell of Team Fortress 2. This game has great potential but currently, it sucks. I would have rather played Wonfenstein: Enemy Territory, not because it is free, but because it is better."

You can also leave the discs playing the the level select menu to listen to while you do other things. Paid two dollars, got a game worth more that seven dollars. Worth more than every cent. 10/10 Varios."
