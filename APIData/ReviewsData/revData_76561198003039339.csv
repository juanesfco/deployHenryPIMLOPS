2013-12-20,225260,False,Terrible PC port of a lucklustre and confused game. Is it free roaming exploration? Is it hack and slash combat? Is it squad based action? Is it an RTS? It tries to do all of the above and does none of them properly.
2013-03-31,200710,True,"Simply everything you wanted in a Action RPG. What makes it great is endless loot combinations. Exciting loot drops come in with regular consistancy and you'll be having to make some tough choices as to which awesome gear you're going to equip. It's well worth the price tag, and generally more fun than some other recent ARPGs, *couch*Diablo3*cough*"
