You must build your town, and into a city to defeat the other player(s). I recommend this game for players who can multitask (No offense), as this game is crazy with multitasking. You need to organise your army, economy and allies. If you aren't sure to buy it, watch some games of Age Of Empires to get an idea of the game. In conclusion, this game is well made, and i would recommend it to anyone who love strategy and medieval multiplayer type games.P.S It would be awesome if they enabled Age Of Empires to be accessable to mac platforms."
