2015-01-28,295110,True,Quite possibly the most indepth survival MMO to date. the game has been out for less than a month and most of the major issues have been fixed or almost fixed.. myself as a aussie player was concerned for the 'LAG' of US based relam but its very playerble. the loot can be daunting to find but i think its a good thing.. i dont really want a full inventory in less than an hour.. you really have to work for it.. the Pay2Win element people complain about is all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.. if your stupid enough to by airdrop and deploy them you will either die by the zombie hoards that spawn with them or players that rush to the area.. its much the same as 'rust airdrops' 9/10 =)
