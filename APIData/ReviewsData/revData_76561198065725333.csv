2013-12-08,211820,True,This game is my Game of the Year for 2013. If you liked Terraria you'll LOVE this. Just imagine Terraria. In Space. With WAY more things and a THOUSAND times better.
2016-08-26,471710,True,"This is easily my favourite VR game at the time of this review. Raw Data and The Lab are good, Fantastic Contraption is great, but this is amazing. Everything about this just has a feeling of being part of a group of friends. And it's free! Seriously, get the game and give it a shot, you've nothing to lose. It's better if you have a mic but you really don't need one."
