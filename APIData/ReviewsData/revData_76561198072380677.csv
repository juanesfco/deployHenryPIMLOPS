2014-11-23,107410,True,"Arma 3 Was An Outstanding Continuation From its previous game Arma 2, the things i love about this game is the sheer liberty to do what ever you want with limitless possibilities like flying a helicopter in races death Matches tank wars sniping driving and even content creation, how could it get any better,Cons: listen the game is absolutely amazing in perspective but there is a little bit of a let down, if you dont know already the amount of vehicles and weapons immensely decreased since arma 2, Where is our hind f35 or even and f18 or at least a black hawk. So there you are that was my opinion on the game Arma 3 Yours Sincerely, BLAZE 420XX"
