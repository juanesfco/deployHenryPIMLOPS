2015-01-19,239820,True,Met and beat my expectations. Challenging and fun with heaps of replayability. If you value the historical journey of the video gaming industry then this is definitely a title you'll be looking to pick up and play. 
2014-02-06,221910,True,"Blew my mind, worth every dollar/penny/pound/euro!! One of if not the best game to come out of 2013. An approach taken that I have not seen in a video game before. Your sanity will be tested in this short but extremely fun title. If you haven't bought it, if you haven't played it, then we simply can't be friends."
