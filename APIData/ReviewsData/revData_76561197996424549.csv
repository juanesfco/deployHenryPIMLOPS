2015-04-26,230190,True,"Dungeon Keeper 2 was and is still one of my favourite games, I've reinstalled that game mulitple times to replay it but its always unstable and now as a Mac gamer I also have to run it through Crossover/Bootcamp, its a hassle. I've hoped for a new Dungeon Keeper for years so when I saw the kickstarter for WFTO I jumped straight onboard. I didn't play it while it was in beta, I wasn't interested in guiding the game through its development, I just wanted it made, I didn't play it when it first went Gold, I heard it was buggy, and read the message from Subterranean Games, so I waited a bit longer, until today...This has been sooo worth the wait, I'm only a few levels in but absolutely loving it, it looks fantastic and plays brilliantly and hearing Richard Riding's voice brings me straight back, thank you Subterranean Games for bringing this classic gameplay back to life with such love, I can finally throw away my DK 2 install disk!"
