2014-12-30,213670,True,"After playing this again, and again, and again i can finally decide that i should make a review for this. This game is amazing especially if you're a south park fan. This game is a RPG styled game, kinda like Mario and Luigi back in time, you can pick a class to choose between: Fighter, Mage, Thief and Jew. For me personally i liked the Fighter the best, his skills were my favourites. This game is worth the money, although it is short if you rush it (Which i didn't) this game will be worth you're time. Have fun!"
2013-12-04,91310,True,"Amazing, Just purely amazing. I loved this game, the sad thing is that it only took me 2 days to finish it. Since i did get the DLC things i played as the criminal, his story was pretty sad. Anyways, this game is just amazing. You should tottaly get this! 10/10"
2016-08-19,437220,False,Very harsh to new players. Combat system is strange but is still sort of playable in a way...Fighting against players who have way more experience against someone with low hours is really the worst.
2013-12-04,210770,True,"well, it's a 5/10 for me, i mean it's a great game with wonderful graphics but...you can't even see yourself reload! that's just stupid! and the god dam assualt rifle is useless as crap. Although i did enjoy it a little. I would say you should buy this game if you don't like seeing yourself reload and you like games where you can shoot, build and survive."
