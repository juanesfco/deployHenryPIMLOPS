Get a controller or just the keyboard and mouse load up and make your character, and RP (Roleplay) If you like Dishonored, Oblivion, or and kind of RP game out there this is the one for you! Play your way, vampire or werewolf, Invasion or Defend, Craft or Buy, most of all shout at people! So Yes I recommend this game!"
