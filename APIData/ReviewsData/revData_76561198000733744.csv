2016-04-25,252950,True,"This is a great game but the problem is matchmaking, you may go up against a party of players in unranked and you will lose. Unless you have friends in a party in unranked games you wont enjoy yourself that much. Finding ranked games is semi hard but at least you dont have to play against a party of players, you can play in solo matchmaking games in ranked"
