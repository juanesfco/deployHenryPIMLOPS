2014-04-13,245550,True,Great watch! Really pulls you in and makes you realise that something can come from all of this gaming. Especially for families that are having a hard time or the individuals themselves.15/10
2014-03-23,113200,True,"Huh, what? Oh, sorry I was caught up playing this amazing game called 'The Binding of Isaac'. Just imagine a bible got thrown at Link's face and he died .... That's basically this game in a nutshell, man.15/10.... seriously though, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing!"

2014-02-04,221100,True,"I'm recommending this game but only because I believe that it has potential. The game is borderline unplayable at the moment with nothing optimised, bland menu screens, and it just gives new players a really hard time. It's so hard to find decent weapons/loot at the start of the game and finding water .... don't get me started on finding water.It is still in alpha and I understand that. I just really think that, at the moment, you should buy this for when it comes out and not for the alpha. The finished game will be undoubtedly great!Like I said, I believe this game has potential, but I also believe that Rust easily rivals it at the moment.For the moment, I'm giving this game a 6/10 but only for how it is at the moment. I'm sure that will be bumped up to a 10/10 when it is finished (or at least out of alpha)."
2014-02-03,221910,True,"A first person game which has no guns, no linear story progression ... and just try to jump in this game, I dare you.Everyone must play this game at some point in their life, for it will consume the rest of it.15/10"
