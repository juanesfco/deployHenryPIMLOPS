2014-12-10,8870,True,Fantastic! One of the best games I've played! Gameplay is similar to its predecessors with new features and mechanics.
2015-08-19,218230,False,"After about 5 hours of playing this game, I am already bored. Province is being attacked? Defend it! Enemy province is being attacked by your allies? Assist in the seige! You will die and spawn, then die again and spawn again, then die again and spawn again, then die..... That is pretty much the main gameplay of Planetside 2. While there are 6 diverse class options and 3 factions to choose from which are nice, the most fun I had playing this game was reviving fallen allies or repairing vehicles.Thankfully the game is free so you can give it a try if you want. I however, will give this game a no since I cannot find any enjoyment out of it."
2015-11-03,333930,True,"Very fast-paced, objective-focused FPS with a range of mercs to choose from. Each merc has different strengths, abilities and loadouts to suit any player."
2015-10-28,272890,False,This game would have been great if the controls weren't awkward and the level creator wasn't stupidly hard to use. Thank goodness I got this when it was free.
2015-09-27,57300,True,"This game provides an unforgettable experience that you will love to hate. It includes creepy environments, paranoia, terrifying enemies and a disturbing story to create an excellent horror game. The game may also cause high levels of stress so I would not recommend playing it for long periods."
2015-08-15,200260,True,"If you liked Arkham Asylum, you will love this game! If you are a fan of Batman, you will love this game! If you are new to the franchise, you will love this game! This game is fantastic and the best of the Arkham series so far!"
2015-08-13,252950,True,"Cars and soccer (or Futsal, whatever you want to call it). What's not to like? So much fun!"
2015-01-18,209650,True,Solid campaign and a very fun multiplayer. The best Call of Duty game so far!
2015-01-08,35140,True,"Really fun, cool gameplay, nice combat system, some tense moments (looking at you Killer Croc) and a great story. A must for anyone who loves Batman!"
