2015-10-15,218620,True,"I have invested the last year and a half of my life into this game, and now they ♥♥♥♥ed it with a CSGO case system. GG Overkill.Feel free to do a 360 on this and impress me, but untill then, this game is a DLC saturated P2W piece of ♥♥♥♥.EDIT: Well ♥♥♥♥, they did it. Not a full 360 mind you, but a solid 180.EDIT 2: After giving this a second thought, ok maybe it still isnt a very good system.EDIT 3: after 6 months, the game is mostly back on track and honestly better then it was pre-microtransation update with alot more free content being released.EDIT 4: Microtransations made a relic and only avaliable on the steam marketplace. Paid case drops removed ingame. Awesome!"
