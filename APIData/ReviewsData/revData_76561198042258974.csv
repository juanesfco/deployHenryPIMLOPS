2014-06-13,236850,True,"This game is my new Rome total war, an extremely realistic strategy game which is challenging to even the most veteran of strategists. At first I was angry, it looked stupid and confusing but after the first hour I couldn't stop playing. EU4 isn't a sellout sequel it is a well designed game even though I haven't tryed the previous ones I'm sure this has to be the best one out of them all."
