All DLC has been good bar wasteland workshop which was a bit of a waste of space and really should have just been in the base game.But if you are just worred about price wait till they are all out and grab the complete edition that always comes, but if you are wanting to play the DLC spoiler free the season pass seems the best way, though i am still a little uneasy of paying for something that is yet to be announced.(the have promised at least 5 dlc's so we will see 3 have been revealed third about to land)"

This game is fun free and is not soo grindy that it excludes free to player people.Gold costs if you are interested a Steep compared to other games that i have played but not insane, just do you research before you spend that gold, try to make the most of it.Skirmishs are quick enough to be a short one off FPS hit if you are short on time while battles are invovled enought to be a good long game.My on major Dislike with this game is the Aircraft don't have  a Jostick option which i would have liked to see avaliable when they were added but nothing is perfect.So 4 of 5"
