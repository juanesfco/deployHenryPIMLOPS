2014-05-20,2870,False,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!this game is empty and boring. i tried to play it but got to bored or frustrated at  how to go somewhere. i didnt experience any bugs but i didnt get far at all in the game for the reason its just to dull. i havent tried 2.0 just because the only way they could make it better is to recreate the game smaller and better rather than have a a huge open world thats empty.all the things that it advertised itself for arent in the game. its just boring and outdated. 2/10
2013-11-20,239200,True,"suspenseful at all moments, things going bump, squeeling pigs, terrifying monsters this is a perfect horror game in all ways. for those who want a scare this is recommended."
2013-09-19,238320,True,"This game is great, suspense galore. though the violenced is amped up and it is disturbing. This is not for anyone who cant stomach blood. or naked guys (im not joking there are naked guys in it). brilliant game i give it a 9/10"
2013-08-26,204450,True,this game is awesome. guns feel good and realistic. story although simple and short was oddly investing. 9/10 for me.
2013-06-11,227300,True,this game provides endless fun and u can put your own sound track in the game. driving is tight and intuitive. as the game title suggests it is a simulator and is all the better for it. this game deserves 9/10.
