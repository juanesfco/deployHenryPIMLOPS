2015-07-09,346010,True,"The core mechanics of the game are perfect apart from slight (I dont even think you could call them bugs) issues such as deleting braces which can be a little difficult but nothing game breaking. As of right now the only changes/updates that I feel need to happen are more maps, make the settings more detailed and NOTHING ELSE, THE GAME WORKS, PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE CORE, IT IS PERFECTTHANK YOU"
