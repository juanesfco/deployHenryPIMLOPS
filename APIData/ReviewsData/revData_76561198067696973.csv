2014-12-20,260230,True,"Honestly, I don't really know what to say about this game.It's brilliant.It has moved me more than any game i can remember.Not because of the graphic - I love it though. It matches the game very well.Not because of the puzzles - they are not hard and not the important bit anyway.The message is - the impression of how it was to live under this conditions. The little explainations of items you find...It's not a funny or action loaded game as far as i can say but one of the most impressive so far.It will not appeal to all though, some will absolutely love it some not. But for me it was definitely worth its money and time - and more. A full recommendation from my side. Job well done guys. Thank you."
2014-02-08,49520,True,"I purchased this game on a sale and ever since good hooked completely.It's not only the different characters with their unique abilities, but the constant chase for loot and weapons that keeps you going. Beside the main story, with its side quests, there are several downloadable side contents with main story and side quests who will keep you going for hours, days, weeks and even month.For the last half year, at least, I have been hooked to Pandora and it characters and don't regret a minute spent. I can definitely recommend to play it in single player mode to get used to the world of Pandora, it's characters and enemies.But even more fun it is to play it in the good company of fellows who help you out, rely on you and curse with you when thing just don't want to work.It is not the most realistic graphic - but it would ruin the game if it would be. Give it a go and you won't be disappointed.You will laugh and facepalm at Claptraps unique one-liners and curse the omnipresent survivour drones...Overall the best game i've had in years..."
