Kerbal space program lets you live those dreams to the fullest (with a comical sense to it!). Want to start a Galactic Empire and establish colonies across the starmap? Go ahead! Make naval ships for sea combat? Somewhat challenging but accomplishable. Create military ships for space combat? No law says no! Tanks? Heck ya! The TARDIS? Talk to the Doctor about that one."

A rifleman is the most common class used, but what really makes a team is the command structure (Squad Leaders and a Team Leader) and how well they can carry out their objectives. For example, a TL's job is not only to call in recon planes and drop mortars, but to also give distinct and precise orders for the squad leaders, so that the squad leaders then give orders to their squads to complete the orders given out from their Team Leader. Each squad has something special about them, whether it has a machine gunner, engineer, assault class or simply an entire squad of rifles, all of them play a specific roll.In the end, the outcome of a battle in RO2 is not from who gets the most kills or who gets a so called '360 degree noscope on a camping n00b', but from tactical decisions, strategic planning and making sure that each member of the team does their part, commander and all."

2013-12-28,241540,True,"While it may not be the best open world zombie strategy around, it certainly gets bonus points for its features. graphics aren't that good, and setting them to the max is just a way of the game lagging out. (I reccomend setting it to low or medium) Zombie AI is somewhat okay and the zombies will react to the player or any noise that is in their range, in other words: They can't see you, they can't eat you, just don't be too loud. Next, homes sites you find and move too have different pros and cons, like an area closer to supplies or an iscolated place far away from zombies. You can interact with survivors to either scout for supplies or accompany you. Otherwise, a great game with awesome features,7.5/10 at best"
