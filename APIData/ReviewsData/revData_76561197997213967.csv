2014-10-30,292630,False,This game is very very very bad.Please for the love of god dont play it.If you happen to get it for free idle it for cards and move on.Under no circumstances should you actually pay money for this game.

The vastly superior, engaging, and thought provoking story is reminiscent of such classics of literature as Animal Farm and The Stranger. It is simply the finest work of art to ever exist.This game also laid eggs in my eye and I spawned forth hundreds of flies.So please play this marvelous masterpiece and spawn its fly babies."
