2016-05-30,326670,True,"Warhammer Quest (Deluxe version reviewed).I found Warhammer Quest an enjoyable game, well I should say I still find it to be an enjoyable game as I am still playing through WQ, nearing the final quests. Admittedly I've always enjoyed the Warhammer universe, turned based games and fantasy so I'm getting a little something extra there. There's a good selection of playable characters and quests to be completed and while some of the quests feel a bit samey there's enough of a story line going on and variety that, for me, it didn't become too annoying (that said there *are* a lot of quests too!). There's plenty of loot and booty to be had and I'd recommend holding off on purchasing weapons in some of the many towns you will come across because levelling up your characters in the latter stages of the game can become pricey and I found that I had a backlog of characters needing to be trained. I discovered that a lot of the quest reward weapons and random drops had me kitted out pretty well anyway. The game quests are designed to played through in a short period of time, about a half-dozen to a dozen rooms in total. Any of the general quests in the wilderness will likely only take a half hour or so if you don't find yourself getting into trouble and the story-line quests will take a little longer. While there's no form of permadeath nor any major punishment when your adventures die it can be annoying when your whole party wipes-out in a dungeon because you get swamped by monsters because of random spawns during combat. The vampires tend to be just as powerful, if not more powerful, than you so you really need to get your strategy right. Don't give up though as when all looks lost you can steal victory from the jaws of defeat (and only by the skin of your teeth) and that when I enjoyed the game the most. The only major annoyance and criticism I have is that some of the game mechanics (e.g. those pesky vampires and random spawns) could have used a little more testing and tweaking as occasionally it's a little unfair in its imbalance. I was fighting a Vampire Lord and just when I had his accompanying retinue sorted and about end his undead Lordliness another vampire spawned, around the corner and well out of my reach, and proceeded to heal, disable and resurrect until I was completely surrounded and outnumbered four to one. Slowly but surely my brave adventurers met a grizzly end. Frustrating but, like I said, no major penalty incurred (but man it sucks at the final stage of the dungeon). Well, more critters to be stuck with my blade. If you enjoy Warhammer and enjoy turn base roll playing then I certainly recommend WQ and also a simple introduction to the genre."
