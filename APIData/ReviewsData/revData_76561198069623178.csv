2013-12-20,440,False,"Valve,I just want to address that DEMOMAN SHOULD NOT be  in  the game of TEAM FORTRESS 2. It is a NOOB class because you can plant bombs and use you NOOB TUBE (grenade launcher) to shot around corners and take out inrange sentry guns easily.This class should either be replaced with a new class or just totally deleted from the game; you can change it a bit but that won't make a difference at all; for just how OP (over powered) it is.Sincerely, Fluff67890"
