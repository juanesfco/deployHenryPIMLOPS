For $19.99, it might be a bit overpriced, but lower the price to $14.99 or $9.99 and you've got yourself a great deal! 6 player co-op in a wave based system was a great idea that sounds a little like Call of Duty: Zombies, but i assure you, this is a completly different expirence. Most maps are around 9 waves long with a 10th 'Boss Wave' to finish the game. Through out the game, you can buy guns, melee wepons, grenades and body armor, but on the higher difficulty levels, it seems you never have enough cash to buy what you want, which means going without that badass shotgun or that samurai sword for yet another round.Final Words: If you have some steam friends, get the boys or girls together for some great zombie killing!"

I guess that's what The Walking Dead is about, watching how a specific set of surcumstances pulls some people together and tears others apart, all whilst walkers are usualy ocopaning the local dark corner. The Walking Dead: Season 2 is great because of not only the story and voice acting, but the fact that you don't see some generic Clemintine throughout the game, you see the Clemintine you shaped and moulded from season 1, which makes all of the struggles much more unbareable. And that ending, no matter which of the 5 possible endings you chose, it will always be a tear-jerker. Final Words: With twists, turns and spills, The Walking Dead: Season 2 shows that Telltale's point-and-click Walking Dead spinoff is not a one hit wonder."

This game was very fun while it lasted, as the run time is very short, (1-2 hours for main game and Freenium or Die expansion) but thankfully i bought it on sale at around $0.99 AUS. The platforming is fun and enjoyable, whilst the combat is just your standard one hit type, no challenge afair.Final words: if you have some spare change in your steam wallet, throw it at this game."
2014-11-08,208090,True,"Loadout is an amazingly polished and fun little 3rd person shooter. This game is comprised of 4v4 battles on small-medium maps over a variety of game modes, including gamemodes with the likeness of Kill Confirmed (from Call of Duty), Domination (also Call of Duty), Conquest (Battlefield) and also some unique ones to. The art style is very cartoony not unlike Team Fortress 2. Also, all of the pay to win bulls*** has been patched/removed, and now i belive it is one of the most fair F2P games on Steam.Final words: fun game, may take a little to get into, but when you do, you'll be hooked!"
2014-11-01,207610,True,"This game had been sitting in my wishlist for a while, and once i finally mustered up the courage to pay the $24.99 price tag and boot up the game, I was not dissapointed. Now, obviously no one is going to buy this game for the gameplay because it is just about as simple as point and click games go (meaning it has a lot of pointing and clicking), but the story grips you by the lapels and eats at your brain with all the twists, turns and choices you make. The only bad thing i could say is that maybe they could have used more keys for action rather than just the Q and E keys, i mean i think after plaing The Walking Dead: Season 2 (and posibly The Wolf Among Us) my Q key will resmble all the zombie heads i smashed during this game.Final words: If you like the look of it or have had it recomended to you, you'd being doing the gaming comunity a diservice if you didn't have it on your library."
