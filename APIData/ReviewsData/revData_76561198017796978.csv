In the beginning the battles can be challenging, but after a few hours of playing you just tend to spam the ememy with torpedo-planes and submarines to take out the battleships from the distance - would really be awesome if the AI would balance the battles better in the late game stages."

The planets look nowhere near as good as in the screenshots here, render distance, framerate and the whole UI is horrible.I keept playing it because i was hoping for the game to get better later on, but it dosnt. You have pretty much seen everything there is to see after maybe 1 hour, all that changes is the color of the planet."
2014-08-03,232810,False,"Right now, this game has nothing to do with the Populus you played 25 years ago. It's a click orgy and feels like was developed for tablets only. There are no menues of any kind, so you have to learn mouse-gestures - no support for the right mouse button either! It feels very much like it was developed for tablets only.The game pace is terrible slow. Most of the time you will just sit around and waiting for the pink bubbles (your mana points, which allow you to do things like terra forming etc.) to pop up above each of your settlements, which you then have to collect by clicking on them. Let me repeat that: if you have 200 settlements, you have to click 200 different pink bubbles to collect your 'mana points' and progress in the game. So most of the time you end up just sitting around doing nothing and just wait for the next bubbles to click on, which is as much fun as watching paint dry - except that paint will dry much faster than this game progresses. It's just a huge disapointment for me. Save your money or pick up the original Populus on GOG instead."
