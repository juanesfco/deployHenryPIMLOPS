2014-06-14,243280,True,"I'm a sucker for cute characters and that was the main reason why I bought this game. I really, REALLY underestimated the greatness of Poof. Once I started playing, I couldn't get enough of it. The game started off very simple but as I spent more time on it it became trickier and the missions became harder to accomplish. Don't let looks fool you. This seemingly adorable game is full of surprises, fast-paced action and is devilishly addictive. I keep coming back for more and it's worth it every time."
