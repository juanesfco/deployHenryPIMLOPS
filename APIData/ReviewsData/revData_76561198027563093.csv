2013-12-02,238960,True,"Exactly what I wanted Diablo 3 to be. Although with any mmo rpg I have this system, if I can get up to level 30 + and still be enjoying the game it has done well. at this current time I have found no issue with this game as to levelling and I just love the loot system in this game. I've been soloing this game the entire way so far with no loss of enjoyment although that may just be because that I like to be underpowered when I take on bosses too increase my sense of achievement. While this game is FTP, you can expect there to be some micro transaction involved with it. Majority of the items that you can buy are just vanity and pretty much don't serve any purpose, so you can totally play this game without the need to spend any money on it. For a First class game, I would recommend this game to anyone who loves dungeon crawlers, phat loots or wanted to wash that sour taste of reaching inferno mode on Diablo 3 out of your mouth.I would recommend this over Torch light 1/2 so long as you don't mind the dark gritty look or always being online. Not to mention they have a dedicated server for Australia!   "

2014-09-24,251870,False,"I don't know if the game actually got better or if I had just stop caring all together, this is a visual novel, plane and true, although though out my time of playing this genera I have yet found a VN that actually made me cringe and angry, until now. I don't know as to where my character came from, but if he gets excited over the fact that a tap happens to produce hot water, convenience stores are open 24/7 and sell food, RFID cards along with other random crap that most people know of, then I don’t care. If they had made him somewhat compepent and not completely stupid, then it would have made this game bearable (I understand the reason why they did I, but it's just random exposition at this point). Not to mention that some of the definitions they give are not completely wrong, they aren’t entirely correct either.I would maybe recommend it if it was $2, but even at the discounted price I got this at, it’s not worth it, not even as a joke."
2012-07-15,107100,True,"This game is really well put together and, but personally this game has enough in it to keep me playing it. that and the nar' voice in this is just so awesome X3"
2011-12-27,72850,True," What can I say, I really enjoy this game. The only thing that's letting this down for my is the interface but that was easily fixed by switching to the 360 controller. highly recommend :D"
2011-07-04,58200,True,It may not be one of the best point and click adventures but this is one of my personal favourites. if you're a fan of monkey island or just any point and click i recommend this (really fun to play). 4.5/5 pirate dogs
