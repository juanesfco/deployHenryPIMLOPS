Game is almost pointless without DLC, so even though it costs a lot, I recommend having all of the DLC, or at least majority of it for the full experience.The game has become a lot easier the longer it has been out for, so it's pretty noob friendsly by now. And the amount of free weekends and sales on there's no reason not to have it in your library."
