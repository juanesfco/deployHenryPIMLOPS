Awesome addons such as FTX Global, PMDG, etc. make the game even better and the multiplayer brings it to life. Occasionally you go online and realise the a kid is flying the plane and annoying you :P. Definitely get this game, even if you don't know ANYTHING about flying; you will learn as you play it. (just like me)."
