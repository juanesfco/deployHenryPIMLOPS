2015-06-18,48240,False,"3 machine activation limit this is how it went for me:1. install on PC2. install on laptop (uninstalled a little later due to space)3. changed graphics card and had to reinstall4. did a reboot of PC a few weeks later, bam can't play need to buy againHorrible DRM (my first time starting the game took about 3 hours of trouble shooting just to find away around around the DRM)the game is good, but dear god save yourself the trouble and don't buy this"
2015-08-20,354640,False,"a 30mb facebook/mobile type game, you can spend thousands of dollars to build a line of 5 identical low quality houses, years of your life waiting out the timers, or you can buy a $5 full game with no ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practices, and doesn't play on people with addiction issues(also if thats not enough, first thing you will be greeted with upon startup will be a music-less main screen asking you to sign up to thier service and sign a user agreement, and if you sit on that screen for more than a minute, a background process that runs with the game will likley crash)"
2015-11-10,377160,False,"'Is this game as good as it should be?'1) 'No' - Nope2) 'Yes' - Nope3) 'What Game?' - Nope4) 'Sarcastic' - This is everything that we you have come to expect from fallout games from the 1st all the way to now, and totally hasn't dumbed itself down to pander to consoles and a more casual player base...(aka Nope)I have put in about 300 hours (alot of that was the game running in the background whilst I waited for it to load and getting distracted, or trying to build a decent settlement with the restrictions forced on you), so how can I dislike it, its a good(ish) game, a bad Fallout game...Fallout 4 has all the hallmarks of an RPG—quests, experience points, towns, trading, companions—but it’s all pretty superficial. It’s like a tribute act to an RPG: fine at first glance, but look a little closer and you realise that ‘Elvis’ is actually a guy in a cheap wig.The quests are just as bad. After 300 hours of play, I can think of literally one or two that offered me the option to avoid, charm, or otherwise think my way out of combat. (and that is being generous) -This game is Par, if steam has neutral ratings that's what this would be-This is a console game, which happens to be on PC as well...-You will still like it if you get it on PC, but you will like it a lot more on console...-You want a good RPG buy The Witcher 3, you want a adventure FPS buy Just Cause 3...or this (think boarderlands lots of shooting...very little story and dialog, or character development)-Enjoy your cultural vandalism-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Quotes from the creators of Fallout 1, 2 & New Vagas, from an interview days before release...-Interplay founder Brian Fargo: “One of the edicts from the original Fallout was that you could solve every problem either by brute force, by trying to charm them or by trying to sneak your way around,” he tells us. “So, to take those three options and apply them to every possible scenario, I think that was a core tenet from a design perspective of what Fallout was supposed to be.” One example was that even the final encounter with The Master in Fallout could be talked out. =&=  “One of the things that I like is that they do a really good job with taking ideas that would normally be mundane and giving them a lot of personality,” -Feargus Urquhart, Obsidian CEO: 'I think people play role-playing games for the story and characters' =&=  “It was always our intention – and we do this in all of our games, but in Fallout we did it even more – to have interesting characters that make sense and have interesting motivations, that people can relate to. And it seems that particularly in Fallout: New Vegas people really see people like Mr. House as these real entities and not just figments of our imagination.”-Co-founder of Obsidian & author of the Fallout Bible Chris Avellone:  “Quest and exploration freedom that, at the least, can be accomplished by a stealthy, combat, and “talky” character. Often, many more options are presented.”---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Summary:it's still worth the money and it is a good game for what it is: an adventure FPS. This review would be positive if they'd just remove Fallout from the title. As they won't I will judge it as a Fallout game, in which case it is a disappointment.Fallout was all about meaningful character development, fun interactive conversations and varied interesting quests, this game has none of these."
2015-05-07,346900,False,"This Game is pretty addictive...which in this case is a bad thing, if you have ever played a facebook game or MMO long past the stage of enjoyment avoid this...It's just a cookie clicker...a very addictive cookie clicker..."
2014-01-26,218410,True,"At first I was not 100% sure about buying or passing mostly owing to the simple art style and the fact its a tower defense which are a dime a dozen now days, however after looking at reviews and seeing some high praise and checking the forms and seeing active Dev's interacting with the community decided to give it a try.The first thing I met was a user agreement which is fairly common now days however unlike others I actually read it was very simple and easy to understand made a nice impression and told me about their attention to detail before even accessing the first screen of the game, this attention to detail was further proven once within the game the customization in just the options menu alone warrants this game being noticeable, I can't say if you will find it worth your money but if you have a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket or see this on sale (well worth full price in my opinion) grab it.This game and its Developers are like a Unicorn in this day and age they clearly care about their players and the product itself Will be keeping a eye out for future releases from them.If you have any doubts look at a few of the stickied threads to see the developers love for the community and the game, and notice that to date there are 377 Positive reveiws and only two negative :P"
2016-05-05,404090,False,"$50 (for Australia, although we pay in USD on steam) is a bit much for what you get.all up priced separately as:1st 'Automatron' - $102nd 'Wasteland workshop' - $53rd 'Far Harbour' - $25Season pass - $50$10 + $5 + $25 ...$40, so until a future DLC is announced you may want to hold off on buying this (there is at least one more, I am lead to believe, although it would need to be over $10 to make the pass a good deal)========================================================first one 'Automatron', adds craftable robots, which is pretty cool, and a small two/ three hour long mission (and two well crafted 'levels' to explore) - as far as DLC goes not bad.second one 'Wasteland workshop', adds some content for base building, if you use mods your not going to be seeing particularly anything new really, does add some (bugy) cages so you can spawn monsters to fight aginst each other (but again before this people where doing this already with console commands, would not have been long before someone made a mod that was doing pretty much what this already does) - not really worth it by itself.third one not out yet 'far harbour' promises to be a large map expansion (aka new world, if you have played skyrim, think like the Dragonborn DLC) - may be a good DLC, but cannot say as of yet."
