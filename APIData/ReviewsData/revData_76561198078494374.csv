2014-01-21,7670,True,"'A man chooses; a slave obeys.' Rapture is a vibrant fantasy world beyond your wildest dreams - it something to be remembered because it was so unique. The imaginative world is very dark, mature and dystopian. Grim tidings indeed. An astonishing philosophical journey - and an elaborate comment on free-will - accentuated with an incredibly enthralling and equally chilling 1950's time capsule.The gameplay itself is the oriented towards survival horror but warped by intense action. This means that resource management is imperative and tactical play is emphasised.  I still consider BioShock to be Ken Levine's magnum opus; BioShock is one of the most exquisite and compelling arguments for games as art. Overall, a poetically beautiful game that is a striking testament to the best gaming can offer. "
2014-01-21,44340,False,"For context, I have Windows 8 Pro 64-Bit.The problem is that this game is heavily dependent on GFWL which is riddled with compatibility issues. I have tried all practical - and some unorthodox - methods of trying to get to the game to work but to no avail. For $14.99, not really worth the gamble. Maybe for $4.99, but probably not at full price. If you do venture into this most unpredictable realm you should expect serious issues from the get-go. I am not saying that it definitely will not run on your Windows 8 computer but be prepared for stress. There is a decent chance the game will not run at all."
