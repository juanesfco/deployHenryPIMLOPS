2015-04-24,72850,False,This may very well kill what made the elder scrolls stand out on the PC.Modders have worked in the past on the basis of collaboration to make great things. That won't be possible here.On top of that bethesda and steam think they are owed a 75% cut for what may include none of their original assets. Think again.
2015-01-22,9480,True,Best of the series in my opinion. People used to the newer versions might have trouble adapting to the dated graphics and it seems to run at 1.5 speed on PC. Otherwise it's definatly worth playing.
