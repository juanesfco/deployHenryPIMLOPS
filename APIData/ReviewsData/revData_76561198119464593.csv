2015-10-03,248570,True,"Toribash is very addictive. If you are bored and need a 'Free to Play' game to keep you busy, you should get this game! At first, you would probably find the game confusing but after randomly causing your ragdoll to do multiple backflips and 360's, you'll eventually understand the game. I used to really enjoy playing this 2D ragdoll game called 'Ragdoll Masters' and this game brings back memories from back then. Toribash still has a few minor bugs but otherwise, it is a very enjoyable game."

This was my very first game on steam and it was definitely worth getting it.There are 21 bosses in the game from what I remember and tons of weapons you could get. You can fight monsters, build anything, and explore! You can join in your friends' worlds and team up together to defeat the bosses.In my opinion, I would recommend this game for people from ages 8 and above.The game is also available on iOS, Android and Console (XBOX, PS3).10/10"
