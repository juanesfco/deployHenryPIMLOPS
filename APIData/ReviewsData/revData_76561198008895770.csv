In fact, if they offer more content in future, but ask for a higher price so that a good porition will go to charity, as well as paying the developer's wages, then by all means... I will pay. I will gladly give."

2016-04-24,427520,True,Playing this game makes me wonder if I have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Complex... Everything MUST work in a set way! WHY IS THERE COAL ON THE GEAR BELT? Where does the production line start? Where does it end?I look forward to what else they can add into this. Perhaps a city builder can be added as a late game thing. Who knows? All I know is that I got a factory that demands to keep growing.
