You can no longer choose what map to play on, or region you play in, or even stop the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking from putting you in a server with 400 ping. (this happens to me 1/3 connects) When you do finally get a game, there is no voting hackers off, no scrambling for evening of teams, long periods of 12v8. Generally every game is a one sided stomp."
