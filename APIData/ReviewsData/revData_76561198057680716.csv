2016-01-20,359550,False,I like the game but its still a little buggy like you can get stuck in objects and cant move and when some one can shot half a clip at you and on your screen its like they shot one bullet then you watch the replay and its commpletely diffrent. when you shot some one with just about a full clip and you die to them and you watch the replay and you dednt even shot. But when the game works its quite fun to play. Thats why i cant recommened the current version of the game.
