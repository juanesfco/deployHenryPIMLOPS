At the moment you cannot close your shop so that you may change some things around, instead you have to save your game then reopen it. This is the only major complaint; a smaller one would be that there are things that indicate features that just haven’t been added yet (for example a quest board with nothing on it).Now for the, as I mentioned earlier, potential. Some features that I feel would make the game much more interesting include:-tEmployees (people to sweep the floors or security).-tHero’s that enter your store and make custom requests for a quest they might have taken on. -tSome more random events ( e.g. people vandalizing your store)-tA store quality rating-tDecorations for your store (paintings, vases or chandeliers)-tSome more creative shop expansions (a second floor or balconies)Apart from all this I really can’t wait to see the future of this game and all it has to offer."
