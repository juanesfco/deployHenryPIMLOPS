2016-06-28,390340,True,"I am a massive resident evil fan have liked every game in the series and that's saying alot about how i approach a game when it comes to playing any game especially a resident evil game i approach with is it scary nope well it is fun oh ♥♥♥♥ yes find a good server to have a blast on i went 4 hours straight in one server it was that good.so this game is basically a solid squad based shooter with zombies sprinkled on top sure makes for some interesting fights once that jammer blows watch out for the zombies that are about to put there teeth in your ♥♥♥♥ or do it to the other guy and enjoy watching the zombies have an afternoon snack. Yes many will pan this game for not being a resident evil game in the regular way but still it's the fun that counts is it not I have played with a mouse a keyboard this entire time and have had no problems had to tweak the mouse sensitivity to get it to handle the way i like but now i will outheadshot any prick with a controller anytime.As a final note umbrella corps kicks ♥♥♥ but it is not your regular resident evil game but it is still very good for the genre it is going for so just enjoy the whole point about bringing the omnomnom by destroying there jammers so the zombies can bring the douchbaggery, shooting the ♥♥♥♥ outta them or taking that dude's brain out up close it's a helluva fun time Now do i recommend this ♥♥♥♥ YEAH"
