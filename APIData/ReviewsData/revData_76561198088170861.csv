However, the agents in the game is really a party foul when your travelling in space. For me at least, they would block my path to a worm hole and i kept getting shot down. I understand that you are supossed to grind and build better ships but the difficulty of the agents are too damn high...Overall, this is very very VERY good game. Hopefully, they will be adding more playable matches and even a multiplayer mode where friends can work together  in the same fleet and conquer the universe."
