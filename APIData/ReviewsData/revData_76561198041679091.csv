2016-03-14,4570,True,Only played a good one hour or so of this game but I have fallen in love with it. I'm normally not a fan of strategy games but this has blew away all my expectations withing the last 60 minutes. I cannot wait to jump deaper into this game and give it a much more in depth review. I got this in a bundle and it well worth the $15 AUD.
