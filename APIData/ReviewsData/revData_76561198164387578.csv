2015-09-29,346900,True,"Game is Highly Addictive! Its alot of fun......at first it may seem alittle plain and dull but give it a few more minutes and you wont want to stop playing.........Another really good thing is that you dont have to sit and play to be playing nessessarily too you can let it keep going while you do other things for example i have alittle one who needs feeds/nappy changes so theres no having to pause the game or exit to go about your buisness, you go and simply come back and in the meantime you have earned a Alot of money!!!Very good game for anyone with an older computer/laptop, plays really good as my laptop is about 6 years old and in no way designed to play any games, and this game plays perfectly! so im really happy and lucky to be able to play anything on my laptop."
