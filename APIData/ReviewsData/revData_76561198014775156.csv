2016-03-07,415950,False,"Pros- You get to play as an Evil Little Girl who wants to watch 'The World Burn'- You get to OGLE at NAKED MEN(Pre-re release version)- Realistic ragdoll physics- Unreal Engine 4- Free Original Soundtrack(Check your Yohjo Sim OST folder)Cons- Steam version got CENSORED due to conservative gamers' complains.(you can still get the uncensored version via the website).- One map that takes you like lesser than 5 mins to explore- Repetitive, no objectives, no goals or whatsoever, you can get bored pretty damn fast.- Barely any objects to interact with in-game.Overall: 1/10 Whenever I see this game in my library I wonder what happened to my $5."
2016-02-19,310950,True,"Challenged RZR Infiltration and Xian at an SFV Launch Event Today.Got Perfect KO'ed twice.10/10 would lose again XDOn a serious note, this is a $60 'EARLY ACCESS' game and Capcom has failed to label it as EA.There is no arcade mode available at this point of time, disconnects are pretty frequent for some reason and people can intentionally DC to keep their winstreaks(WTF, Crapcom?).Honestly I wouldn't recommend this game until they fixed the matchmaking at least, add in Arcade mode and DInput support."
