2015-04-03,3710,True,"Well, i dont know too much about copyright issues, but they could be kindly and added, even as dlc, the comic to the game, since its a pre requisite to understand the plot. I will recommend it anyway because i paid less than a pretzel for it."
2015-03-14,242920,True,"Overrall, excellent game. Its pretty limited, but its because its just what the creator wanna it to be.Yeh, i know, its weird say it, it bothered me on the first days too, and i got a bit tired of the game now that my village got 200 peoples, but the propouse of the game is different. I went on the forum and there were a lot of discussions about peoples wanting fights, etc. what is pretty easy to put in, since the engine of this game is the same they use on the last 20 years for all kind of rts, but looks like everyone reject this because the public of the game are people tired of war rts and just wanna a nice medieval (im not sure if its medieval, maybe the game take place on the first years of united states colonization?) simulator.This said, i find particullary annoying that the game dont have even robbers and such. Also ok, some peoples dont like wars, but it was a common place at the age the game pass on (even if the game take place on the new world, the natives would be a problem), but ok, i respect the creator for not doing something that players could just switch off if they wanted (like you can choose do with disasters and harsh climate), and why i respect it? Because its his choice, not because he is incompetent (i hope), thats what usually happens when something goes missing on any game.I dont know if he keep updating it, probably not, since the game is bug free since i know and he already had put everything he wanted. Still, i hope he find a way to make the game more fun, but probably it will keep the way its now. The game is simple, still a bit challenging and complex, and thats fine.Now where they really ♥♥♥♥ed up: the game has no STEAM CLOUD.Even free to play visual novels like everlasting summer, or old games like postal 1 and 2 have it, and its pretty troublesome because simulators like banished are pretty personal, if you have to format your computer or install the steam in another place, you will have to back up your saves files manually. I dont know how steam cloud works, and banished is far from being the only game with this problem (euro truck hasnt steamcloud too and this ♥♥♥♥ me off), but they should work on it."
2014-11-02,278910,True,"There is a lot of potential on it, i can see by the sprit of the descriptions around the game (the few made at least). But first, this game needs a campaign mode. A lot of peoples will say it doesnt need, but this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥rt. Frozen synapse wouldnt had any need for campaign too, but it has, and its pretty nice. Shamefull few peoples played it (there is an achievment about finalizing the game that there had less than 1% of completion), and i can say that if peoples played more the campaign, the game would have more public. I mean, TF2 wouldnt be the most played online FPS if valve didnt invested so much making videos, comics, etc.Problem is, as i can see, the creators arent putting it on this stage because the game isnt developed. My advice is that they make at least a small campaign (six missions) at first and make another ones when the game advance. I cant find anyone to play online, i didnt see any artwork on the community, i guess with a campaign this would be solved a bit. This said, i shouldnt recommend the game right now, maybe in one year i change my mind... actually i would HOPE for it, because i like this kind of game, but i will positivate it because till now its is one of the few turn based games that didnt killed me in boredoon."
