2014-02-20,49520,True,at first i was a little  unhappy with the game playing it as a single player not connected to to internet . I then decided to try it as a online game and my opinion of the game changed entirely as i found other players  and as a team we worked our way through the levels. when playing alone i got to level 35 and was starting to tire of the game since playing on line i now have 1 character at level 72-op8 and have a extra 7 characters on levels 21 to 60 looking forward to *bring them to the 72-op8 levels i also have purchased 1 of the special characters that are not included in the original set.
2013-12-02,203160,False,i am unable to get this Game to run on a I5-2500  with 8 gig of ddr3 ram and a gtx 650TI Graphics card  Game will load  to when Lara is hanging from a rope over a pit at the start and you are requested to swing  at this point Windows 8.1  will freeze  .i have tried to contact Nivida and Microsoft to no avail i have also tried to contact steam help but again to no avail . if you look up Tomb Raider on the internet you will see that i am not the only one stuck with this Lemon of a game.
2015-07-29,261640,True,"I know a lot of people do not like this game ,i was a player who was a little disapointed about the story line and all the bugs but since a lot at patches and some very mundane DLCs . i have found the Game greatly improved since the claptrap dlc was added . I now enjoy the game very much and only wish that there was more add on features to the game like there are in bl2 , I know a lot of people who play it and enjoy it and some who like to complain about it I personaly   like it and will pay with any one who ask i have 4 level 70 characters and 2 level 67 so i have put a lot of game time into it and may have a better expectation than some one who has played for a hour or so."
