There seems to be no good answer to this problem as the only 'solutions' are allowing it through your fire wall, and changing your DNS which didn't work, slowed down my internet, and It doesn't even semm worth going through all that trouble for a game like this. Really disappointedOverall rateing 0/10 - waste of computer spacePros - NoneCons - couldn't even ♥♥♥♥ing play the game"
