However, there are too many other problems with the game that are just too big to ignore. Predominantely:- Graphics: While they are good, Codies have gone from looks over actual gameplay and functionality.- Multiplayer: is absolutely woeful. It's impossible to race against anyone effectively when the game can't keep up with who is where on the track. All of a sudden, you get told you're in first, and before you even cross the line, someone else has crossed it and pops up a fastest lap.- Push to Talk: Why was this stripped out of the game? I don't want to voice everyone in the game if I'm speaking to someone privately in a TS Server.- Glitches: ie: refer my posted screen shot - how the hell can a car drive around on rims!?!?!? This isn't the only one.- Gameplay assists: There's absolutely NO difference between Traction Control being off and on Medium. There was at least some difference on 2014.- Steam Achievements and Trading Cards: Despite doing at least 10 clean laps around Russia in a Marrusia in Time Trial, the game fails to recognise these laps towards the achievement - I don't know why. The game also claims to have Steam Trading cards - I'm yet to see any after nearly 4 hours of play, and a friend has 10 times as many hours (40) and hasn't seen any either. So the Trading Cards are a blatant lie at this stage.Codies - if you bothered to look at the Meta Scores in Steam for your games since 2010, they have been steadilly declining, with 2014 being the worst of the last 5. Your track record suggests that this one will be the worst of the lot. If you can't get your ♥♥♥♥ together, you don't deserve a renewal to make more of these games from FOM.There's just one question remaining: Did anyone at Codemasters even bother to test this game PROPERLY before it was released?**EDIT: SInce my review, allegedly, trading cards have been released. **"

These games will give you much your enjoyment and keep you entertained for much much longer than this game will.For the purpose of the review, I stuck at this game for 18 hours according to Steam before finishing it. Honestly, after the first hour, it was a sad reaity that all one would do the for majority of the time was sit and stare at a screen and click a few buttons every few minutes.This game should be rated 'P' for PATHETIC. It feels drastically un-finished, the game physics are poor (and have been demonstrated by numerous others who have played this game). I'm sure whatever money that the Developers have made from this game, they wouldn't be able to take into a Brothel and organise a root. Seriously, what were they thinking when they made this game?!??!!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME - YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY"
