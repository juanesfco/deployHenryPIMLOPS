This game is like Simcity but with alot more stuff and expansions that you can have to make a city, as of Simcity I understand that the Cities were meant to support each other but made it really not fun to play. Once I saw Cities: Skylines on Steam I went OMG is it really going to be better than Simcity, then I read some of the Reviews, most saying that this game is frickin AWESOME! So, yeah, thats why i bought this game and if you are into City Simulation I Deeply Recommend this game.Tips: Buy the Game!!! Rating:10/10 'Simcity on Stelroids!'"
