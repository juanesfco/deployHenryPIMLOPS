It has one of the fairest free to play models out there whereby you may only buy cosmetic upgrades, no boosted experience or OP items. The one drawback is the always online connectivity which depending on the stability of your internet connection can either be drastic with the loss of a hardcore character or absolutely transparent if you have great connection to their servers. Overall, for a F2P it's a must play."
