While I sat alone by my computer, I realised I had given love to two fictional characters while I sat here with no one. Their love was not mine, but I had it for a brief moment. In the course of giving up my life, i gave two others love for awhile. If you want to feel loved, buy this game. It will leave you feeling lonely but loved as you finish the game. You may have no one, but at least you let two others have love. For that lonely Friday night - I felt loved. And I never want that feeling to depart, so i just keep playing again and again, as if I'm watching my ex living out her life without me, when all I want is her back."

2011-12-27,630,True,Amazing Co-op game that had some much depth but sadly abandoned. It is now hardly ever played which is rather sad. If you can get together 4 of your friends all with voice chat this would be a fantastic game. But you would get bored with the limited maps. Alien Swarm: a game with so much possibility

2013-12-27,251990,True,"The general impression I got from everyone when they saw me playing this game was “ew why are you playing a game so girly”. But once you look past it, this game is really strong in all aspects. It tells a great story, allows you to play how you want to play and the music is really strong. It is a good gateway for an experience in being a royal member, or just an important figure. What you do is important for your people and you. The choices you make and the lessons you take can turn your road to coronation to a sadly short life. Each death you have you looking at what you did wrong and how you faltered in your classes. The real strategy of this game comes from taking advantage of your moods to get the most out of your lessons. The reward of surviving so much is very satisfying and it makes all of the deaths from chocolate and bandits on my way to a birthday party worth it. I have no regrets getting this game, and it would be there up there as one of my favourite games."

Now you can even play games with a total of 32 players, however, I've only every seen one other playing in the online lobby, and he was AFK. The game play isn't fantastic but I thoroughly enjoy this RTS. I appears much slower paced than most other RTSs I've played. Although, I would only buy this game when it is on special, like now for instance."
