2015-06-27,325610,True,"The Total War franchise has recently been surrounded in hatred with the disastrous release of Total War Rome II, while it's predecessor Shogun II was regarded as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Total War title thus far. Now, onto the review. The first thing I say is - it is DEFINITELY an improvement over Rome II, not doubt in my mind. The two differ; In Rome II, it is about building your chosen nation to glory, whereas in Attila it is mainly about maintaining your empire in one of the most turbulent time periods in Europe's history.On the topic of Attila himself. I have one tip - always try to destroy The Huns before Attila becomes ruler. Attila is born beginning of 400AD, and the game starts at 395AD and has 4 turns per year. If I'm correct you have 20 turns until Attila is born.When he becomes ruler, boy, you are in trouble. He constantly spawns stacks that harrass the player, especially if the player chooses a Roman Faction. He is truly the Scourge of God.The Western Roman Empire (or the WRE, referred from now on) is in a state of military and economic decline under Flavius Honorius Augustus. The empire is being attacked from all corners and civil unrest is everywhere. The WRE is severly overextended, and from turn one, nations declare war on them and destroy them.I found the WRE didn't really succumb to the barbarian invasion, instead break-away nations such as Britain, Africa, Gaul or Hispania took over parts of the Empire. These nations are have the Roman culture, so Roman buildings, units and leaders. Overall I didn't feel like the WRE fell to barbarians, but to its rebels.Onto the features I like:Cities are unique; Londinium, Roma, Constantinople and Ctesiphon are just a few. You can now bust through the walls of the impenetrable Theodosian Walls and set fire to the Hagia Sophia (Even though the Hagia Sophia wasn't built until circa 500AD, under the reign of Justinian.) Improved combat.Family trees.Horde mechanics.Dat Rome I menu like doe. Ect.Now the negatives:Diplomacy mechanics are identical to Rome II.Faction panel still confusing.Sassanids and Huns (when Attila is ruler) are op.NO ATHENS! If you feel like you want a big faction that is easy, play the Sassanid Empire, not the Eastern Roman Empire! I made that mistake myself, and a couple of turns later the Visigoths took Constantinople and destroyed all of Greece.TL;DR - The game has improved on Rome II, with cool new features. It, however, still has its flaws. Overall I would recommend this game.SCORE - 85/100Update - I have no idea why Steam"
2016-03-14,271590,False,"Before I go right into my rant I LOVE the single player to pieces. I completed the game, fell in love with the characters and spent ages going all across Los Santos. The SP aspect is 9/10 without a doubt. World feels alive and exactly how remember Los Angeles when I went there in 2013, especially Venice Beach! Now, onto Online. One word - cancer. Hackers fill all the lobbies and constantly kill innocent players and have every item without any effort at all. Rockstar is ♥♥♥♥ing hopeless. Money bags get dropped on people (happened to me three times, each time Rockstar banning me for some reason???!!??? ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!) Everytime I have sent in a support ticket, getting replied by a bot one second after posting. Nothing happened. I'm banned until 2035 for people dropping money on me! (Rage twelvey mode) ♥♥♥♥ YOU ROCKSTAR! It happened to my friend too. At least I don't have to go Online to deal with ♥♥♥♥ing cancerous hackers anymore. Single player is one of the best games ever made, Online is on the other side of the spectrum. Don't go online unless you want to rage. PS, avoid the money bags like they are Ebola. Cause when I went online and got banned which was late last year if you touched one and you would be banned. Hackers still plague online I bet. They always find a way to use their ♥♥♥♥ tactics to ruin the game for everyone."
2016-01-27,377160,True,"Great game, too bad people ♥♥♥♥ on it because they want to sound unique or seem edgy or cool.  Encountered a guy who said all reviews for Fallout 4 are 60% negative (obviously making ♥♥♥♥ up) . Don't even go on Metacric. All the player reviews give it a zero. A ♥♥♥♥ING ZERO? WORSE THAN A ♥♥♥♥ING BARBIE GAME? It isn't what people expected, but sure as hell exceeded mine. Don't listen to the ignorant ♥♥♥♥wits that say the game is bad to sound edgy. The game is great, buy it, and for the love of all things ♥♥♥♥ing Barbie, do not look at the player Metacric reviews, or you will die of how cancerous these wannabe 'critics' are.+Weapon mod system+Voice acting+Settlement crafting+Moddability (Better mods will come with the release of the creation kit)+Graphics (game looks great on Ultra, and with a couple of extra graphical mods)+Perk tree+Some quests are fun to do+VATS no longer overpowered-Story endings (quite linear)-Dialogue options dumbed down-No low intelligence options (my favourite ;( )Game shifted from an RPG mechanic (don't get me wrong, still like an RPG) to an FPS approach (does it really well)."
