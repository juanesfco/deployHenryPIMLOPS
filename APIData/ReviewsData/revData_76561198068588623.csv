2014-04-15,238240,False,"This game is not as cool as it looks. Get Starbound instead, this game is still early access and is a lot harder than starbound and terraria, I won't recomend this until it has improved, better world generating is needed and it is not r than terraria or starbound until it has improved, I really Regret buying this game. (wasted $20)"
