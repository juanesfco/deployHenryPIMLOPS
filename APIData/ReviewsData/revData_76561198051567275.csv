2015-06-06,319050,True,"While it does have it's issues, Chaos Reborn is a solid game.GameplayAt the time of this review, Chaos Reborn has two main gametypes in multiplayer: Classic and Equipped. Both modes handle very similarly, with Equipped mode allowing usage of talismans that you acquire by earning gold. I'll explain more about that in a moment. Anywhere from 2 to 4 Players take turns to cast spells (such as summoning Allies in the form of Elves, Dwarfs, Skeletons etc., or blasting foes away with Magic Bolt) and attack. In addition, everything is based of chance, so there are no health bars to keep track of (although I prefer health bars myself) e.g. it is entirely possible to have a dwarf defeat a dragon, even if the chance to succeed was only 9%. Some people will find this hard to handle.AestheticsChaos Reborn does a good job handling the graphics on all levels. Based of the Unity Engine does have some limitations, but everything has a nice consistent art style and the detail is consistent. One of my main gripes with my prior Robocraft review was that Robocraft's graphics worked against itself. With Chaos Reborn, I can't complain.SoundtrackI haven't listened to it much, but the sounds are as good as the graphics - consistent and making sense.CommunityIn the time it took for me to write this review, I had been waiting on a single League game to arrive - and yeah, I never actually got into a game. I would like for the developer to at least let us know how many people were on what gamemode, just so that people can find other people to play against. Unfortunately, outside of playing public matches and connecting to a central server, there literally is NO OTHER WAY to earn gold to buy new talismans and upgrade equipment. Apparently the upcoming Realms is going to introduce a better way of earning gold, but I am skeptical. Oh sure, you can play offline against others in a Hotseat match with bots, but you won't earn gold that way. Even if you could, you would have to still connect to the central server, so hmm.ConclusionGood game, but lacking good ways to keep me interested in playing online with others - especially when no others are on, which the game won't tell you about.Also, in the time I wrote this Review, I never got into a game of Chaos Reborn to earn said gold."
2014-12-10,301520,False,"Don't get me wrong. Robocraft is a perfectly good game and all, but I do not recommend playing it. I will address why towards the end of the review. For now, let me address the critical aspects of Robocraft as a whole.GameplayThe Gameplay ranges from average to great - solely depending on how serious your teamates are about winning. The game consists of you and your team building whatever vehicles you want and setting about demolishing the other team. As of the date this review was made, you can have access to 5 different ways to blow the enemy sky high: SMGs, Plasma Cannons, Railguns, Tesla blades and a Nano-beamer which can restore allies vehicles. You can stack Tesla blades with other guns, but you can't have an SMG with a Railgun. The problem is that these are not very well balanced: Railguns are far worse than Plasma cannons, just as an example. Remember how I said that the battles can range up to great depending on your teammates? If you are using a railgun, you are literally dependant on your allies protecting you while it is recharging. And it takes a long time to do so, during which you are more vulnerable than a snowflake in a volcano, for lack of a better analogy. And since blowing up enemy vehicles is a part of the game, you can blow up individual parts of the enemy vehicles - in the time in takes for you to read this review up to here, you can now fire your railgun again, except you can't because someone has blown it up. Now you have to wait for someone else to come across and restore your guns so you can defend yourself. And now you are dead because your healing ally is busy polishing someone else's vehicle. And this happens more often than not. I should mention that the tier system in place for research (yes, research requires you to acquire Tech Points in varying tiers, and unless you pay real money, there is no way to cross-tier your Tech Points) is not that great - more than once have I seen Nano-beamers (which are acquired at Tier 7, minimum) used in a Tier 2 or 3 match, I have once had the pleasure of seeing an enemy using a Tier 10 Plasma in Tier 4 - Ouch is a massive understatement. At least now you have boss fights where a lot of T4s can fight a big, bulky, one-shotting T10. But this happens so rarely it might as well not have been implemented.There are items you can acquire to help you stealth your way around the map, such as Radar Jammers, but then the enemy can just spot you by pressing Q - which makes you very obvious to every enemy on the map - so there isn't a point. Also, only two parts of your vehicle - the pilot seat and the block it is sitting on - determine life or death.In order to acquire better stuff, you either pay endlessly (It takes at least $20 and a lot of grind to unlock everything in one sitting), you have to not only acquire Tech Points, but also Robo Points which are used for purchasing stuff once you have it available. Up until recently, dying yielded you a lot less points, even if you wiped out more than half the enemy team - the emphasis is on surviving rather than killing. Ironically, killing is the only way to acquire more points to pore into your vehicles. And that is pretty much all I need to say about the Gameplay.AestheticsThe Aesthetics are not exactly what I would call good, but it isn't terrible either. Robocraft is one of those games where you can literally build anything you want and it would be the way your vehicle is. Wait a minute, 'build anything you want'? Isn't this somewhat vaguely familiar? As in overdone by this point? Not that this game does it poorly, but I think I have seen enough ugly vehicles, that are ugly on purpose, but I have seen some rather... rude... looking vehicles. There is very little moderation in terms of vehicle aesthetics. Otherwise, some of the maps are very good and are pleasing to look at, but then you build a flying vehicle and seen the endless plains outside the map. If it were me, I would have just used a skybox - they already implemented a force field to prevent you from leaving in a flying vehicle. At least a high-res Skybox would have been acceptable, and would yield less complaints, and would have been a lot more processor friendly. And that is all I have to say about Aesthetics - they are only graphics and are only responsible for maybe 20% of a game's value.SoundtrackThe soundtrack, even when the music volume is on full, can be rather quiet at times. I get it, it is supposed to create tension when I do rarely hear it, but if anything it annoyed me. Maybe that is because I prefer the soundtrack in any game to fit what the game is about - I do not associate the need for stealth with a game that is clearly about blowing the pilot seat out of a heavily armoured vehicle, and where stealth does little more than get you killed quicker if you try. I ended up turning off the music and listened to the Tyrian OST - which was much more suitable, but  I just happen to be listening to another game's OST while playing this one. So yeah, go figure.DeveloperI understand most people would not recommend a game because of its developers. This happened to Paranautical Activity, the developers said some rather nasty stuff to their fans and to Valve, and as a result they had their game kicked out. But the Developers for Robocraft are not like that at all. They regularly add new patches to their game to make it more fun - recently, a 'Hero Bonus' was added to compensate those people that die wiping out more than half the enemy team. And they make newspaper articles to hint at new features being developed. They also take some feedback on the odd occassion, albeit more of an acknowledgement than anything. For a team of 10 people, what they have achieved is pretty good so far. I encourage them to make a game that you have to pay money to play, as opposed to 'Pay to win', which is what Robocraft is rather sadly.Anti-Hacker PolicyOk people. I said that I don't reccommend this game and here is the reason. Now, I'm not a hacker, and as someone who will eventually get into game development, I fully understand the concerns that developers have for their games to ensure that people don't cheat to win. But there are far better ways of doing this than using EasyAntiCheat (also called EAC, Robocraft refers to its system as Roboshield). In case you don't know why anti-virus software has such a big problem with EAC, it is because EAC literally acts like spyware. When you play Robocraft, you are giving permission for the guys at EAC to monitor your personnal details. They can rename it however they like, it doesn't change what they are doing. Having access to your data is basically giving up your privacy for security, an area that is already being heavily debated in the Information Technology industry (remember the PAPA framework anyone? If you don't, I suggest you Google 'Mason, PAPA Framework'). In anycase, they tell us that EAC is using the data being data-mined to detect hackers and such, but that is a lot of processing power being used, and I have trouble believing that it is all for 'verification' of the game's validicity. True, this is EASY Anti Cheat that FreeJam are using, but nothing is ever labelled as EASY unless there are ways around it. You may have noticed that less than 50% of Robocraft players are hanging around, and even that number is ever decreasing due to EAC. A far better and more person friendly approach would have been to use Valve's Anti Cheat (also called VAC). For one, VAC doesn't act like spyware, it is server side only (which is another advantage, you can't have your users decompile your EAC on their client to find exploits and whatnot) and uses less processing power which can free up more servers. And while yes, VAC is open-source, this is actually an advantage.And that is the review. DO NOT PLAY until they use VAC instead of EAC. Hopefully, they will correct that mistake soon."
