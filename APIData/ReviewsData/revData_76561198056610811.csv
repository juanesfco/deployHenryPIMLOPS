2016-07-03,8870,True,"Fun gameplay, great story, stunning visuals; All the signs of a great Bioshock game, and a much more worthy sequal to the original than 2 will ever be. On the topic of Rapture, the DLCs feel fleshed out and fun enough to warrent paying, and depending on your taste Clash in the Clouds, a wave based survival add-on, may not be for you."
