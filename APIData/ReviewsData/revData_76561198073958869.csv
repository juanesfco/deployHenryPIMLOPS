2015-04-04,7670,True,This game was full of drama and never ending twists. It was a fairly long game but it was worth every hour. A highly recommended game to play.

2013-12-10,242050,True,"This game is so fun and packed with adventurist things to do, that when i finished the game i was so upset because there was still so much to do around the open world. I highly recommend you buy this game and i personally think Assassins Creed Black Flag is ten times more funner than the past Assassins Creeds. You will not be disappointed. :D"
