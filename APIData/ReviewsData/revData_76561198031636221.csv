2014-07-23,304930,True,"9/10, a fantastic gem of a game. It incorporates elements of minecraft, with the crafting, building and general look of the game, whilst also including core elements from day z - with survival elements of food, water, sickness, blood becoming important. You'll spend a lot of time raiding towns for crucial gear and a lot of time fighting zombies who literally cannot be 'de-aggro'd' (the old 'walk through some trees and lose the zombies' doesn't apply here). The fun increases exponentially when you play with a friend, you can create a base using the massive and (mostly) easy to follow crafting menu/crafting wiki. Setting up a base is a very satisfying experience but it should be noted that players and zombies can destroy and player built structure. The game runs smoothly at the lowest settings on my potato of a rig, but I’ve noticed that any attempt to increase the graphics leads to excessive fps drop. The lowest settings are still significantly better than minecraft graphics, though, so fear not. Currently there is not a server browser for unturned, this makes playing online somewhat of a tedious adventure.. Currently your best bet of finding a server is trolling through the steam servers and hoping to find an IP address/server that isn't full and is actually hosting at the time. I've personally had more success with hamachi servers than the standard IP ones, but even then it's very hit and miss. IF you can find a good PVP server it is great fun and I’d highly recommend trying it out. The survival elements on a PVP match can be too unforgiving though, and frequently you die of starvation/thirst (of course player related deaths are common, too). But there's nothing quite like hunting down the player who killed you last and killing them with three awfully aimed body shots from your scavenged mosin nogant (praise the Russians for their weapon prowess) and then stealing their poncho and tea-bagging the absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ out of their raided, bullet ridden corpse (rip never 4get). Whilst on the topic of player v player combat, BULLETS HURT and you bleed quite significantly after being shot. This is a great bit of realism that makes pvp skirmishes that much more strategic. I'll probably never forget having to use my trousers as a bandage to stop the bleeding from a bullet wound incurred from a friend who was 'trying to test the range of the rifles', what a fething scrubl0rd. I have some gripes about the crafting system, namely how difficult it is to find a canteen or to craft one. I fail to see why we can't use an empty tin can/water bottle to collect water, in fact I fail to see why we can't just drink from the water using the players block like hands (dafuq?). Also it is quite difficult to craft new magazines using empty magazines and combining them with boxes of ammunition. This is mostly due to the fact that empty magazines take up one free inventory slot EACH and cannot be stacked like regular magazines/shells. This makes finding/creating a dependable supply of magazines quite frustrating. I do however like the fact that empty magazines drop to the ground (unless it's your last one) when you reload, this system makes it much more realistic. But it's still an early access game so these things maybe changed in the future.DESPITE THIS, the game is epic. It is free. It is fun to play. It's hilarious with friends AND for a measly 50mb download you literally have no reason not to give it a try. TLDR; Great game get on it scrubl0rds. "
