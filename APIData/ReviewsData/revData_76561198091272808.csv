2016-06-09,72850,True,"I remember the first time I saw this game, I was young, naive, and I hadn't seen the light of Lord GabeN (No steam). I went to EB games with $70 to spare. I was looking through the isle when this light caught my eye, it was a holy light, a light of which I'd never seen before. As I approached I could hear a choir of angels singing, filling my soul with righteous temptations. Temptations to mod, temptations to fight dragons and slay the evil of some far away place. When I touchd it I knew, I knew that this had been crafted by the gods themselves, that was the only explanation for this perfect creation. An angel came down, she told me her name was Aela, and that by purchasing this perfect creation I could see morre of her and be in the realm of the King of Gods himself. She guided me to the counter, her holy light forcing all the unholy corruptions away. When we aproached the counter, I reached in my pocket, and when I looked back the cashier had turned into a dragon! It had scales as dark as night, and red eyes that pierced straight into my soul, and it had Aela! It told me that since it could never see the light of Lord GabeN, it would never alow anyone else to. It took a deep breath, and I thought this was to be the end. But it was not to be, Aela threw me her sword, it's holy power guiding the hilt into my hands. I slashed at its neck,it screeched in agony. The beast lunged at me, but the holy power of the sword enhanced my reflexes and I managed to jump out of the way while taking a swipe at it's neck. The beast was furious now, it did not expect it's prey to fight back. I lunged at the beast, my holy sword easily piercing it's unholy hide. It howled in agony, for it new I had one this fight. As its unholy flesh burned, I looked to find Aela, but she was nowhere to be seen. In her place was a note that said'Meet me in the land of Skyrim                                               -AelaP.S. nice beard'I had no idea what she was talking about until I reached to my chin to find a beard. Not only that, but I had grown. Where as before I was a 5'3, I was now 6'4 with a majestic beard and ripling muscles. I rippd off my tattered shirt, put the money on the broken counter, and walked out of the store.And thats the tale of how I found GabeN."
