Some free and paid DLC comes out, which is fine as I'm keen for more maps. However, the DLC keeps coming and coming, begin thinking Overkill is going overboard with the DLC. Still waiting on things that were promised before the beta was released, features that were fairly basic and should have been in the game. I was content to just stop playing and leave it at that, but then Overkill brought out this microtransaction weapon skin ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, despite their insistence that microtransactions would never happen.So now I'm here, giving this a negative review. It's a shame really, because the game was great at first. But then they just got greedy and now we're left with this. Before they implemented microtransactions, I would have said, 'At least they didn't get as greedy or as stupid as Turtle Rock Studios did with their Evolve DLC'. But Overkill went the step further and completely one upped them, which is a pretty (un)impressive feat.Damn you, Overkill. You ruined something that was fun."
