I Kept getting a 'LaunchPad was unable to connect.' error and hen i went to the site provided by them the help was unable to assist with the problem. I had to wade through the material they had on file and still could not find an answer to the problem. I then tried to log a ticket with Sony and the account I had just made was invaild and I was reqquired to make another avvount with Sony to log a error and ask for some help. Not to self and a warning to all stay away from Sony online games. they just screw you over and waste your time."

2015-11-14,386360,False,Don't bother with this game it has a eliteist community that doesn't take the time to help out new players. its simply a pay to win game. NOT WORTH THE TIME TO PLAY AND LEARN
