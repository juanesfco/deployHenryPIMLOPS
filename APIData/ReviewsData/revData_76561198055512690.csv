Your first step in this game is to beat the Wall of Flesh and get into hardmode. Some might say that's the end, but it is only the start. MORE BOSSES, MORE WEAPONS, MORE ARMOUR, MORE ENEMENE... ENEMENEMEN... ENEMENEMENEMEN... ENEMENEMENEM... ENEMENEMENEMEN... you get the point right? JUST MORE OF EVERYTHING!!!!6/10 Needs more explosions. Joke. It is a decent game to play with friends or while bored."
2015-01-22,244850,True,"AWESOME GAME!!! YOU HAVE TO GET IT!!!!!!!!!Seriously though, this game is AMAZING!!! You can play in survival or creative mode. Survival mode is where you gather your resources and build what you can afford to build. Creative mode is kind of like Minecraft in space, BUILD, BUILD, BUILD and BUILD!!! In this game, you can use your imagination to build whatever you please. You can build a giant Mario that can fly around and shoot rockets at asteroids. You can also steal random ships that appear and destroy them for blocks or use a solar station to produce energy (mainly survival). Also this game can be played either with Single-Player or Multi-Player. Just saying, but ANY GAME WITH MULTI-PLAYER IS BETTER!9/10 Just... Awesome."

It is very closely related to world of tanks and minecraft because of its ability to build your own robot fighter to destroy the enemies robots. I highly recommend it to anyone with the spare time to play it!9.5/10 Disconnects lots, but other than that... BEST FREE GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED (JUST better than Toribash)."
