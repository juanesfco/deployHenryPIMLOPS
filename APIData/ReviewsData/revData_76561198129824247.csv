I love this game's customisation with the mechs and of course...THE GAMEPLAY! The multiplayer experience and the ai training gives this game a great dose of players. Congrats to the company who made this game, and I hope to see you guys making more games for your fans!p.s That garage girl is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO hot!  :D"
2016-04-26,223470,True,This game is extremely stereotypical and extremely fun. It teaches me to regret nothing and made me build a Postal Dude voice. I love it!
2014-10-28,220,True,"Half Life 2. Oh Boy what can I say about this one....... One of the great modern fps ive ever played, seriously with its unique storyline and gameplay, this is truly a must have for fans of fps. I especially like the way you can move with the post apocalyptic world that you currently inhabbit. This game is a must get. Thanks Valve! You have done it again! (Although this game is 10 years old)"

All its physics are real...i think...and is the most fun I can ever have on my computer.If you are a fan of FPS such as myself then wait till you play this!But beware, this game requires a hell of a lot of teamwork and skills (Unless you are a spy)I recomend this to anyone who enjoys all of the above.Thank you Valve for creating such an epic FPS, keep it up guys!Lachlan the Prophet"
2014-08-18,236390,True,"This is a fantastic and entertaining 3rd person/ stragety game for those who enjoy World War games and vehicle mode gameplay. This game is beautiful in so many ways, graphics, gameplay, multiplayer, open world and the action. Warthunder is a definate recommendation from me, because of the great gameplay and features it contains.I am bad at this review arent I?"
2014-08-11,234310,True,"Yet again! Another stragety game! I like this game, but I find it really mysterious...If only I had a better computer to properly run it...Finally a game that features Australia!!!I'm on my Aussie side!"
