2015-11-26,249550,True,NEStalgia is  a game where John says he opened the one chest that had the vital quest item but in reality he never opened it and we spend an hour wandering around the cave trying to figure out where the crystal is and John is certain that he had opened the chest that had the crystal in it and John is bad.
