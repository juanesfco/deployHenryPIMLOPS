2015-10-09,330830,True,Do you love Borderlands? If you answered yes buy this game
2015-08-16,310370,True,Amazing game with multiple pathways to different resolutions. The art style is unique (a lot like Super Hot) and the music is really good. I would definitley reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys a quiet game such as Gone Home.
