2015-12-28,359320,False,"played less then 2 hours of it and i have to say, the toturials are ♥♥♥♥, games play is so dry and boaring idd rather eat a soggy sao."
2015-09-29,287700,False,spent over 2 hours doing the mission to rescue emeric finaly got him and ran from the Metal gear and the game tells me to run from it so i do and it leave the mission area setting me back alost 3 hours of game play. very poor checkpoint system and no save ruins the fun of the game. apart from that its great but setting me back that long is total BS.
2014-06-10,220240,False,After taking a break from it for 12 months come back to find that my account is inactive. ask to reset password... website has continual errors on the final stage... you would think a game being sold on steam would let u play strait away but nope ..... the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at ubisoft have there own system and it doesnt work. so good luck if u forget your pass word becuase u just lost your game.
2015-10-16,219640,False,no single player and not enough official low rank servers.
2015-10-10,325610,True,"Great game, plenty of mods in the community so ignore the whiney ♥♥♥♥♥es who complain about the DLC. u can get more from Steam workshop for free. as far as game play goes modding is need for some nation to take a year from 4 turns to 12 so that nation is playable but other then that, to me as some who has played thousands of hours of total war game its one of the best behind Rome II."
2015-10-10,346110,False,first experience. log on try to join server and it says 'Snapshot 16' and it wont connect to servers. i followed some basic steps to fix this (basicly u have to run the game as it not intended) ran it in 'no sky effects' mode and it worked fine for 2 hours. just started to play with some friendly people and enjoying the crafting system then game crashed.... TADA GAME IS NOW COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE. now connection errors and wouldnt let me connect to the server no matter what i tried. not to mention the poor design of the server lists and the fact that u cant find the last server you were on so u dont lose everything. Basicly i found the game far to full of bugs and errors that the devs seem to ignore but make the game unplayable. $30 is far to steep for a game that should be sold for $10.
