Rise Of Flight United is a great example of a good game being screwed over entirely by one feature. That feature is the dread microtransactions, the lifeblood of free games and the terrible part of gaming. At the start of the game you have 3 planes or so, thats all the planes you have unless you want to pay $20 DOLLARS FOR FOUR STUPID PLANES!!! FOUR!!! The game is good overall but technically only 3 planes in the damn game i can not reccomend this."
