2012-07-13,620,True,I don't even need to say anything else except THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES OF OUR GENERATION!.
2012-07-05,207250,True,"Oh man, great indie for only $2 WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Seriously though , there's a tower defence game mode and a versus mode that's really fun but what you really want this for is the multiplayer. Heck get it with a friend and you're only paying $1.60 each. That's two potato cakes or a really good game your choice really."
2012-05-17,55040,True,"It doesn't look like much, but the simple graphics hide a really good zombie-survival strategy game with an on-going campaign where every decision you make actually has long term effects. You are an evacuation manager who has to co-ordinate the evacuation of civilians and (hopefully) the eradication of zombies. If you like Indie games and/or enjoy strategy/management, this is worth it."

2010-12-19,22600,True,Just like the classic Worms of old! Remember those 2d days when you'd spend hours on end in grudge matches to see who's the best? If you like Worms 2 and Worms World Party then you'd love this!
