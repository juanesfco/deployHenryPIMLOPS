2014-09-11,275530,True,"Alright were to start off I have always LOVED the Original Z form Bitmap Brothers and is STILL my favourite game of all time and still have the disk :DThis remake I don’t think is too bad but there are some things I think the original has done so so much better. -The map feels really in your face I know you can minimize it to the bottom right but if you click the X it really should stay minimized unless you want to bring it back up again possibley in the menus.-The Massive X’s I know that this was sort of a port to PC from handhelds and tablets but I think you guys should at least clean it up and make it more Z’ish or maybe even remove them all together. -The X’s during cut scenes should be removed surly by pressing space or escape should be enough to end the cut scene and get straight back into the action.-The screen before the battle I feel should go back to the original.-Id really like to see the original main menu be brought back and updated if possible-The green buttons on the bottom left might be best to change them to the original and maybe even the menu  button instead of having it as a pause.-When pressing the pause button to bring up the menu I’d like to still see the game not taken to a different page kind of what the original did.-Gun placement should I also believe needs to be redone by having the gun you are trying to place becoming the pointer.-Guns if you select and want them to focus on a target far away should be brought back like the original.- I’ve noticed that the light tank seems fires from the hatch instead of the turret. (jeep,  medium, heavy so far seem to be okay haven’t go far enough yet to see the mo missile).-The players AI units don’t seem to be very smart (snipers, toughs, grunts) the rest seem to be okay so far.-Buildings if destroyed seem to have lost their  textures.Some Features id really like to see: Level builder and be able to share your maps on the steam workshopMultiplayer is a MUSTThats all i can really think of so far"
