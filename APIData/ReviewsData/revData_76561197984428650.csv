2014-03-13,4500,True,"An open-world RPG/FPS on steroids.Throw what you knew about role-playing shooters out the window, this is a whole different level.The world is BIG. There is no fast travel. You walk EVERYWHERE.The weapons WILL jam and deteriorate, and different weapons need the correct ammunition (e.g. 9x18mm, 9x19mm, .45 cal and 9x39mm in pistols alone). Then there are different types of ammunition (e.g. Full Metal Jacket, Shotgun Slugs, Shotgun Buckshot, 5.56mm Armour Piercing, Tracer rounds and so on).Your armour will also eventually deteriorate depending on how much you get shot at, and you can't take it to a vendor and repair it. You throw it away and buy a new one.Basically, if you're used to games such as Oblivion, Skyrim, or Bioshock, this is nothing like them. This, is everything taken to the limit and not recommended for casual gamers."
