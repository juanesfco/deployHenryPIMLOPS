2015-06-03,346110,True,"Early Access ReviewThe road so far...Ark Survival Evolved has its flaws currently as all day one games in EA, but it has a lot of potential, It has a deep levelling and crafting system, requiring time and effort in gathering and crafting, It's combat is kind of clunky but once you unlock that slingshot you'll never go back to just bashing a dinosaur , while I haven’t manage to tame a dinosaur yet ( started to tame a carno that had attacked my house, but when I went to kill a couple of the massive turtle dinosaur's they wrecked my house and the passed out carno :C )  I think it’s an amazing and fun, engaging mechanics making you care for that one pet you will value over the rest. So far only the graphics to play this are letting it down in my opinion (my specs below.)  I hope with more optimization and when DX12 comes out soon it will get a lot better. To list this out.Pro’sDeep rewarding crafting System.levelling system.Massive open world full of horrors and thing's that want you for food.Fun tribe system with friends.Solo offline mode allowing you to learn and get the hang of the game before online.Dev's actually seem to care and have updated the game and fixed bugs all thoughtout day one.Con'sRequires graphics tweaking even for higher cards.Some small physics bugs e.g. body's flying and being tossed away abit.Mostly the biggest con for people is it requires a beast of a machine and even then you need to tweak the graphics.But after all that I’ll keep playing it, because I so far find this the most enjoyable Survival game out.Computer Spec'sProcessor.Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz Graphics Card.NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 Ram.Kingston HyperX Beast 16.0 GB OS.Microsoft Windows 8.1, 64-bit Upgrading my GTX760 soon to a new GTX970 (about 2ish weeks away)Will update my review when It's installed & I've played it.I wish there was more than Yes/No for review Early Access games, but so far if you can tweak the graphics right I recommend this over other early access survival games.Thanks for reading.Deatheffekt.Update #1 Patch 171.511 Hours mostly all in game I doubt even an hour is in the menu/server list, and I honestly say if you can get this running get it, I've loved every second of it.The updates since day one have been great, the game runs way better for me atleast and looks amazing, the hard work the dev's are doing will pay off, and I honestly see this being finished one day if they keep doing this."

2015-06-25,208650,True,"Now I have Arkham Knight on PC & PS4.Played about 5 hours on the PC running on a I7-4770, GTX970 with 16gb's of ram, and swapped to the playstation 4 copy when I got that which I've played longer.I've always felt the Arkham series was desgined and better on consoles given the last 2 games PC launches (City/Knight).I love this series, and will be sad to finish this amazing game. So far the only downside to the PC verison is it's a sucky PC port of an amazing game so far which I find hard to stop playing. Once WB fixes the issues plaguing the PC verison, I reckon anyone who loves Batman & the Arkham Series should buy this,However,  go play Asylum & City if you Haven't (whats wrong with you?!?).I recommend this even currently in its bad port state."
