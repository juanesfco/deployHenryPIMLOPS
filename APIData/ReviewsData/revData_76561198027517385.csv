I'm using a mouse and keyboard and haven;t had any problems , you must like stalth to enjoy the  game . I read that the graphics wasn't particularly good , but in fact they are fine, there'splenty of climbing and alternative routes to explore and always endless guards to get past. As you progress into the game you earn skill points which are used to up grade Styx making the character less vunerable and able to do some interesting things ....like clone himself. I think there could be a bright future for this chacter .especially if they made him more of a warrior (perhaps) . For the price it's good value."
