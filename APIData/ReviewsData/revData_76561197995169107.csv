2010-11-24,8800,True,"At the beginning of the game, keep at least one warrior on your city, while you research Bronze Working. Once you've got that, build an archer, and fortify him on your city. Use your previously fortifying warrior to look for bronze. Once you find it, build a settler and make a city on/near the bronze. There, enjoy your swordsmen. That should make things easier for you."
