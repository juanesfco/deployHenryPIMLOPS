2016-03-10,203770,True,Crusader Kings 2 is an amazing game it tends to be very hard to learn but like all paradox games makes you want to play it again and again it's very in depth and all about keeping your dynasty alive going from a count to a duke to King and finally a emperor it's an amazing time wasting and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to play grand strategy!
