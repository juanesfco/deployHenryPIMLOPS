2016-07-13,227940,True,Apart from the long wait times to get into a server and for the games to start... and the short games... and the fact that it's pay to win... it's a pretty good 'Free to play' game...
2014-10-05,304930,True,This game has a bright future I think.After 30 hours or so of playing theres nothing to do though. But I'm sure after the months pass there will be more and more to do.
