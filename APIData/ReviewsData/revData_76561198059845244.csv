Why might that be? It's not pay to win. Sure, you could buy a warframe and weapons with real cash. But that doesn't mean you're any good at the game. You actually have to take the time to collect mods, upgrade your warframe and weapons. But - if you play enough, you don't have to pay any real money to get platinum (an in-game currency). You can trade with other players to make platinum. Which is fantastic. But doing that takes time. This brings me to farming or grinding. When it comes to having to farm certain mobs to drop a certain recourse or mod, it's actually fun.In summary - the first part of the game may not seem fun. But it gets better. With the various mission types you can do, learning the lore of the Tenno as the story unfolds, the many quests you can do, all the different types of warframe/weapons. Yes I can recommend this."
