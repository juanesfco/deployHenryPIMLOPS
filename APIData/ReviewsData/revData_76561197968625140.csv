2013-08-18,200510,True,"XCOM: Enemy Unknown is, interesting enough, very much a harkening to the '90s days of yore for tactical overhead games, with all the entertainment and frustration inherent. The game succeeds in creating a cinematic, movie-like epic feel of 'Us vs. Them'. However, the RNG basis for the game can be ridiculously stupid, and yes, at times unfair. Essentially, the game is made for save reloading, unless you're going to play through it multiple times with a literal plan - As in, mapped out how you're going to play - Simply for the 'hardcore' mode and the game modifiers available.Polarizing as it is with some of its design choices, XCOM: Enemy Unknown creates an experience greater than the sum of its parts, for the most part. You'll either truly feel like you're fighting the great unknown, or like you're struggling to survive against the great unknown."
