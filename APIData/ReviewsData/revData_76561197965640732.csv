2016-08-12,275850,False,"running fine for a while at 1080p but runs into some issues after a while playing or on particular planets. Did the same at 1440p. Fun to play but definetly need to address performance issues. Great game.EDIT: Running the game in Bordered mode made a massive diffecence to performance for me with 2 monitorsAfter playing this game for a while, there is nothing bringing me back to it. It doesn't have much depth without multiplayer once you do a few of the first items."
2016-07-15,436320,True,Probably shows the best potential for a proper game on the Vive. Has an actual story and doesn't just feel like a tech demo. It's making me want to go buy a new video card. Throwing a blade like a jedi and maneuvering it mid air can never be bad.
2016-06-19,382110,True,"Kept seeing forum comments recommending this app for watching 360 videos. They failed to mention that the videos go from an unbearable low res to acceptable, and it is extremely jarring and frustrating to watch. It was the only reason I purchased this app and can't find much other use for it considering I could use the steamVR desktop overlay with the controllers.A bit unfair to not recommend for a small part of a bigger program."
2015-06-13,346110,True,Good fun and entertaining theme.A game that you are constantly scared of someone or something attacking you and stealing your stuff gets the thumbs up from me. It wouldn't be as much fun without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself when you see a T-rex charge at you. The farming can be tedious but that is all part of the game. Grind for a bit to get the satisfaction of creating what you needed. Needs better optimization and some bug fixes of course but it is still a ton of fun.
2015-04-22,323470,True,Good fun for a DBZ fan.Can get a little repetitive and has a brick wall moment that is really frustrating. Still fun regardless.
2015-04-22,266510,True,Something Different and worth looking at.
