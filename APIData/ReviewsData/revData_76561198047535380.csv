I much prefer the Ancient, Medieval, Europe, Japan etc. It's cool for a niche but I didn't like the game overall personally I love the historicaless shoes of total war on your finger tips  to me that is more fantasy then warhammer. I'd rather play this type of 'fantasy' else where on another series and strictly get my dose of history rewrite in total war because you can't get that sort of dose else where unlike Warhammer."
