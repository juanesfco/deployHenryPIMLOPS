2014-03-07,3900,True,"I'm too scared to play this any more due to its highly addictive nature, its that good. On par with alcohol or sleeping pills for things that make you forget about time, seriously, the only thing that'll stop you from playing this is seeing the sun rise in the morning after an all night nation-building session."
2014-02-19,6910,True,"'If god did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him' Judging by the fact that you are reading this, you have most likely glanced at the game of which this review is about. And you may have noticed the fact the title is partnered with the ostentatious declaration of 'game of the year edition'. One of my biggest problems with this game is that it does not deserve such a title. A more appropriate accolade would probably have to simply be 'Deus Ex: Game of century edition'.Yes, that's right, I found a game that's better than Half-life 2, deal with it 2012 me!This is the part where one usually describes what the game is and a bit about the gameplay, but Deus ex has an exception. But, as a rule of thumb, most people classify it under the simple and undeserving title of 'FPS', a name unworthy of such a masterpiece. This is due to the seamless blend of RPG elements, Stealth and, of course, First person gameplay of the shooting variety (and no, Fallout 3 is not a 'better example' because Bethesda never quite grasped what the words 'role-playing' mean, and give out skill points in as plentiful quantities as the loading time in their games due to the excessive consolization that plagues this industry like the Grey death). Of course, the game is much more complex than this, as you are not necessarily limited to sneaking around urban dystopia and secret laboratories. One can simply go in guns blazing (but this usually results in immediate death) or, in contrast, can complete the entire game without killing a SINGLE person whatsoever. The amount of choice and the way it reacts to your decisions is frightenly high.But, nothing is perfect. The gunplay is fairly weak and the graphics and animations are fairly dodgy, due to it running of the already fairly dated unreal engine. The levels, whilst very expansive and well designed, are a bit boxy and bland, even within the context of a ruined 2052 cyberpunk setting. Its true strength, however, lies within its story. Without spoiling too much it revolves around the player, a 'nano-augmented' agent (don't worry, it is kind of explained in-game) called JC Denton, who works for UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition), a group formed by the united nations in response to increasing global tensions, including a terrorist strike on the statue of liberty (the game was made in 2000, so it was still perfectly fine to discuss terrorist attacks on New York). But as the player fights the various organizations, he starts to realise there is something very wrong with his overlords, and finds himself a player in a secret war for world dominance. The themes, factions and events in the game are likely from a conspiracy theorist's nutty dream, but simply keeping up to date wiht the state of the world simply provides foreshadowing for the dystopia presented in this game! Whilst most of the exposition and dialogue is extremely well written, its delivery and voice acting is not as refined, simply watch any play through of Hong Kong or Paris to get the idea. But, I suppose there is some charm to hearing Asian triads debate about philosophy in silly accents!On the subject of sound, it is quite obvious that the music does an excellent job of making up for the questionable voice acting. When you first boot up a game and simply get chills from the title screen, you know you've got a gem in your hands! All the the levels have an apprpaite soundtrack that suits them, with seperate themes for ambient, combat, conversations and death. Ah Hong Kong, never again will I be able to go anywhere remotely Asian without feeling like stepping into Wan Chai market for the first time...My final word is that you should absolutely buy this game. It is very cheap ($1.74 in a sale!) and there is simply no excuse for not playing this. There is a well-known phrase that 'Every time you mention Deus Ex, someone will reinstall it', but this is complete bullocks because no one in their right mind would ever uninstall it; it is the best 700mb on their hard drive! The point being, this is easily the best PC game, if not the best overall game, ever made. It is really quite sad how no game has ever been able to match it after 14 years in terms of complexity and competency.What a shame..."
