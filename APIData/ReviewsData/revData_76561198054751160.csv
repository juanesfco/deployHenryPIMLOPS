2015-05-15,264710,True,"I will never forget the time when I spent 1/2 hour trying to make a radiation suit with no means of transport I finally did it :D. I swam for about 5 mins getting to the big ship. When I was about to enter there was this huge squid creature that came and scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. I screamed like a girl and died :(...Edit:I have now been back since I last played it and oh boy has it improved much greater then I last played it. There is more suits, Customizable items and builds(Structures) since when I left I now recommend this even more then last time to every one hopefully multiplayer will be added so I can play with my friends."
