2015-03-23,244770,True,this game is fantastic. started by first off shooting a guys ship with my laser pistol and broke a brick. he retaliated by volleying 160 heat seeker missiles at me. 10/10 would shoot first again
2014-06-30,47410,False,"from my playtime of this game i learnt many things. the most important being that if someone wants you dead. all they have to do is spend money and your game is over. i fought in a few of the wars between factions. it was very intence yet still laking as one person could easily defend against attacks of thousands if he played the right cards. in all. it is a massive time sink. if you got the money then go for your life. if not best to avoid this one because when someone comes and raises your castle after around a month of hard work and you loose it all, its not very satisfying."
2014-04-07,244850,True,brilliant game. looking forward to see how well this game turns out in its final form. runs reasonably smoothly. thhe dev team is constantly updating the game and bringing out amazing updates very frequently. i just need a better computer :P keep up the good work
2015-01-18,65980,True,now that i have completed a full game i feel as if i can write a fair review. civilization beyond earth whilst having amazing graphics and relatively smooth gameplay still falls short of reaching civ5's standard. there is no where near as much content and the ai doesnt run as well. a couple of touch ups and a bit of hard work and this game could become a good game. nothing like civ 5. but still worth having in you library. 7/10
2014-12-13,232890,False,this game wasnt half bad. like the rest said it is missing alot of features that the original had. it also requires a little optimization. i run a mid to high range pc and it will lag on low settings as much as it will lag on ultra. with 4 opponents in a skirmish match it makes it nearly impossible to coordinate a proper assault or defence. few things need a touch up and until then it gets a thumbs down from me
2014-11-29,105600,True,insanely good builder. thousands of content and boss fights. everything minecraft is missing 10/10
2014-10-15,270550,True,a amazing time killer. definatly worth my $2. ive payed more than that to be entertained for far less time. most definatly recommend
