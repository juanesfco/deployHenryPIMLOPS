2011-05-09,1250,True,"The name says it all! This FPS Co-Op Servival Horror game based on the UT2 Engine is very fun, not a game i can play all day every day, but on most days :) With 7 classes to play and just over 40 wepaons to play with, some being optional DLC weapons, it makes for some gratifying zombie killing fun!!! The weapons range from duel pistols to  a LAW rocket launcher, Flame throwers to a .50 cal Sniper Rifle...and some insane ideas that just make it silly...but in a good way. Levels are well made with the environment changing from a wecked ocean freighter to the streets of london to a secret forest research lab and a deralict asylum used for rave parties, there is something new to see in every map.a MUST for any gamer who is thinking of getting this game! If you are reading this? stop right now and click the buy button, just go and do it."
2015-07-01,299360,False,"** UPDATED**After playing through the tutorial, i get to the main screen and in the lower left an image of the characters and text telling me to buy the game?? seriously? notification in the game i bought to buy the game? them i get told i need to play a solo game inorder to be able to play in a multiplayer match.....ummm, ok, not like i had any other options as the other 2 game modes were grayed out....so i start a solo game, and a few minutes later nothing, just waiting in a que to have the game start....for a solo game....not a good start, not a good start at all.i will try the game again after a reinstall to see if the 'buy the game' in a game i bought goes away and will report back later. But on this first impression? i can not recomend this game, it looks fun, but it's a no from me at this point.After trying the game again after a while there is more i need to tell, but first Husk, thanks for the comment and seeing if you can help with my experiance with this game.OK, so after coming back to this game after a while i tried it again and went throuth the tutorial again and got all the markers and then went and made sure i was signed up with the devs site and linked my game to them through the account section of the game. I did everything i could find out there to make this game go, then after this i went and started to look for a classic game....15 minutes later, nothing, so i started again, another 15 minutes and still no games. i changed my region to the US, and again the same thing! i tried the UK region....nothing! i ended up looking on steam spy, and even though ther are around 87,000 steam users who own the game, only about 100 - 200 people playing this game at any time. i tried for over 1 hour and using every server to try and find a match and nothing, i could not get one match in just over 1 hour! then i found there is a server browser, after looking in the make a game section of the match making...could have made it a bit easier to find there guys. then i tried all the regions again and looked for games to join, and i found 1 game in europe with 1 player. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH AND ARE WILLING TO PLAY LOTS"
2016-07-12,381210,False,"I want to start by saying that I do have fun with this game, and some times it's the same way that some people have fun by putting needles into their private parts.There is so much that is good about this game and in the same breath i have to also say that there is so much that is broken and needs to be fixed.1. THERE IS NO CONTROL REBINDING! that is right a full launch of a game that does not let you edit the controls. Really?2. The Infinate vault hopping thing. there are so many vids on youtube and times that i have spent waisting time with a survivor that will just hop through window after window after window. 3. Perk Ballance in relation to the lvl of others in the loby. how many times i have come across a high lvl Meg with Adrenaline, seriously that perk is so OP it is not funny, full heal and run speed +150%, at it's best it will full heal from dying state... are you serious? AND after she gets to lvl 30, she can teach it to other survivors.On the flip side lets look at a few killer perks, Insidious for example, after standing still for a few seconds you have no terror effect, or no heart beat to hear, untill you move or act again.Dearstalker, the ability to see aura of dying survivours from a distance awayAnd Iron Grasp which makes it tougher for a survivor to escape from you holding them.These are, in my opinion the best 3 perks that the killers have.If you are going to buy this game, be sure you have 4 friends to play with as this is currently the best way to get enjoyment out of this game. Ther is serious Potential in this game, and i want to see it brought into being, and that is why i bought it... Evolve did something similar before, but this game has the ability to offer so much more.I just hope that the devs hear what the community is saying, and make this something special."

MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE!!!!!no seriously, if you like Sci Fi and aliens and guns and blood and all the things that makes your 16 year old self just craves on an hourly timer....oh man, this game is just good."
