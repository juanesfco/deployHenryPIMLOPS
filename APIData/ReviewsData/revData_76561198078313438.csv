2014-01-20,261030,True,"Highly intense action scenes. Very interactive and one of the best games I've ever played. I highly reccomend this game to anyone that enjoys a bit of zombie killn' and a compelling story line. I'm not sure if this season will be better than the last, but I can already see some great character development in Clementine."
