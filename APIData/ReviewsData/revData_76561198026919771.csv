2014-06-21,10180,True,"One of the best of the Call of Duty series to date. Has a great story that is worth replaying just for the awesome atmosphere and set pieces. Multiplayer community is smaller than what it once was, but is still quite easy to get a game going. Highly recommend to play with friends!"
