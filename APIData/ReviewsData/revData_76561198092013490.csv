2016-01-11,359550,False,"Ah UBISOFT you give me a migrane....Hello Steam Comment scroller STOP HERE FOR A PROPER REVIEW!!!So here's the problem... HOW THE HELL CAN YOU RELEASE A GAME IN THIS STATE (Its BETA at BEST)PROS:-Awesome Ideas and concepts-Games are super fun and tactile-Graphics are great (there even a Super HD Texture Pack DLC on Steam for this)-Little to no hackersCONS:-About as optimised as Watch Dogs (I'm not Kidding its bad)-I don't see the point in release an Ultra Res texture pack (DLC) when high end graphics cards can barely run a smooth 60 on ultra 1080p-I can play on low to achieve 60 Frames per second (My System Build will be in Build Section)-Their are some really funky physics in this game (Up for you to decide whether you like this or not)-The Price to Context Ratio is Rediculious Get This on a sale not at full price unless UBISOFT GET their optimisations out SOON. I f you bought this at full price you are literally paying for 6 siege maps at best, A TUTORIAL and literal Search and Destroy game mode against bots that it-THERE IS NO SLI OR CROSSFIRE SUPPORT !!!!-AMD USERS PAY ATTENTION HERE !!! THE SUPPORT FOR OUR GRAPHICS CARDS is Abosuletly rubbish like Ubisoft thought noone uses AMD anymore-servers.... SERVERS.... SERVER!!!! UBISOFT DO SOMETHING (Before I break my wall with my fist)-Operators a great Idea but WE NEED MORE WEAPONS IN VANILLA NOT DLC-More Weapon customisation-More Operators that aren't DLC or Better yet let us make our own (just saying I'd pay for that DLC)-Driver support for this game are done as well as the list here of Pros to Cons (Absolutes RUBBISH)-Constant Crashing in Multiplayer-Build Section Start-+MY BUILD+CPU - I7 4770K INTELMOBO - Gigabyte Z97X Gaming GT RAM - 16 gb 1600mhz DDR3GPU - Gigabyte r9 390 8gb GDDR5 HD - 2 TB Seagate Barracuda 7200 RPMPSU - Corsair 850 watts PSU GOLDLEMME KNOW WHY I AM GETTING SUCH LOW FRAME RATES !!!!Driver software: Radeon Crimson 15.301.1201Honestly I get 60 Frame if I'm lucky on LOW SETTING SOMEONE HELP ME FIX MY FRAMES ISSUE-END OF BUILD SECTION--Final Verdict-Not Worth you money in current state, It is a great concept but its exicution is something of a disaster, With current Optimisations and game play content I am afraid I will have to give this game a dissapointing review score of3/10- Avoid Buying in this state and watch this review as I will update when things improve or get worse"
2016-01-03,271590,True,"Multiplayer Review Only:you looking for a fun multiplayer game with friends this is for you. First things first the topic of 'Hackers' do they ruin multiplayer honestly some can be annoying but hey guess wat rockstar invented the 'find new session' button for a reason right? yea they did and on top of that some 'hackers' are really friendly and wish to help you instead of you paying for ingame currency is that wrong well yea it is not sugar coating it here it is wrong. But it can be a really fun experience being teleported around to fun jumping locations on a super pimped car. So do hackers ruin the experience depends if they like you or hate you and to be honest the player who hate you in game with give you a harder time than any hacker. Now the leveling system its average if i'm honest complete hiests and get away from the cops the usual GTA feel in the multiplayer might feel a bit repetitive but rockstar has put and continues to put fun and interesting side mission which are completely optional just like everything in the multiplayer, it is completely optional. Now with the interesting thing about the new Criminals and Excucatives is a fresh spin where 'player based' organised events take place in free mode in the multiplayer making free mode even more chaotic fun !!! and plus you get paid for it too. :)I know this isn't a complete review but hopefully this shorten version of it will help you decide. BTW if this is on sale it is a steal and do not hesitate to buy."

2014-07-15,226700,False,Let me start by saying I don't like bashing game developer:Even when their work only shows about a years work of hard effortThis game could have been something that game developers could of made money of if they truely had time for the people who purchased it.I loved this game but time goes by and you see the cracks I mean I like flying zombies as much as the next guys but this is too far.The game developer could of put so much more time into fixing the bugs and making optimisation than adding a new mapplease lets hope their remake isn't so money hungry or bug infestedPlease don't spend money on this game it isn't worth itGame developers I hope for the next time we meet and you take my money it better be for a good game.
