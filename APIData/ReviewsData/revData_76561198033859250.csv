2016-09-13,427190,False,"Although I love dead rising and played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it on the xbox, in its current state I can't recommend it. Although the performance is perfectly fine running at 1080p 60fps, there is a game breaking bug where the game refuses to save and instantly corrupts any auto-saves made. As there is no definitive solution for this glitch, this makes the game broken and unplayable.Once this issue is resolved, I will be changing this into a positive review."
