2014-03-31,213670,True,"The main thing to know about this game is it is very faithful to the TV show as a whole, though that should be a given since the game's story was written by South Park's creators. It is pretty much inserting yourself into the world of South Park, interacting with the world and its characters in fun and humorous ways.The gameplay itself isn't that bad either, anyone familar with the battle systems of games like Paper Mario will adapt quick to this and its easy enough to pick up even if you haven't. However one thing I will criticise the game for is the lack of depth for character progression, your max level caps out at 15 and given how much you can progress your abilities, a max level of 25 I feel would have been better suited.Aside from that, there are a lot of weird and wonderful weapons that you can acquire during the game from Darts to dodgeballs to vibrating ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also many costume pieces can be found, each with their own passives attached such as extra armor or a boost in fire damage.These pieces can be customised further through the use of 'Strap-ons' to give extra benefits like causing bleeding, giving more armor and even recovering hp and pp on perfect attacks.The game provides choices in the game but really they do little to effect the game's story, just more something you will do for achievements and choosing who you will fight later on until a point where the two sides merge.Also hope you like references, cause the game is full of them from the show such as the 30 Chimpokomon you can collect during the course of the game to well known references from the show. As for those who will be affected by the censorship the game's makers put in, I found they don't really do much to spoil anything, just two minigames though I think some audio dialogue in the second half of the game (least in the Australian version) is cut out as well, or just my sound card ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, either or which.All in all it's a solid rpg for those interested and also a game for diehard fans of South Park to enjoy, however I would suggest avoiding it if you are the sort of person easily offended by the style of crude humor shows like South Park provide."
2015-09-23,9880,False,"I have some praises for this game but for those who are looking for a good f2p experience, this is almost definitely not your game.So I'm gonna make this clear here and now.You are probably not going to have much fun with this game unless you sink some money into it since its where most of the content lies. Champions Online is an MMO with a superhero theme to it if it was not obvious enough. I started playing this way back in the day probably as early as 2011 though I didn't really seriously pick it up until maybe around 2013. I played for a while and unlocked one of the 'gold' archtypes with real money. I played, made a character, tried to make a story and such out of it since the game seems to encourage you to do that with the nemesis system and all.But again most of fun doesn't really happen until you either unlock a freeform slot with money separately or you get a gold sub for the game which you can do on different terms like monthly and yearly from memory or you can do what I did and dig in for the lifetime sub that lasts until the game inevitably shuts down.Doing this allow you to access freeform slots which are basically slots in which you can customise every aspect of your character from primary and secondary main stats, powers and skill trees, This is where most of the fun can come into it since you can make the character how you want it instead of having to follow a set skill system but unfortunate it is behind a paywall.That said though from the last time I played it, the game is pretty dead, there are people around yes but maybe 4-500 tops on good days. The end content is kind of dull as well getting your usual dailies and such though there are special 'comic' missions that are basically mini campaigns separate from the main story. Rampages are where you will probably spend most of your time when you get to max level (which is 40 btw) cause it's where you need to farm the materials for the best equipment in the game. Drop rates are pretty bad so you are going to have to grind for quite a while to get anything to drop for you and even then you need like 6 of each item (add there are about 3-4 different rampage items) in order to make a full set of armour and if you have multiple characters, be ready for the long grind.The game is also microtransactions galore from costume sets to powers to 'lockboxes' which are boxes you need to open with keys that cost 100 Zen a piece which is the premium currency for the game in order to unlock special costumes and vehicles that only come from those lockboxes, or just wait until they turn up in the auction house for a pretty penny (ie stupidity expensive cause price gouging is popular with players in the game).However all of that I did ignore cause if there is one praise I have for thise game it's the pretty robust character creation system where you can select from a ton of different options (a lot are premium parts but once unlocked they are unlocked amongst all character and future ones on your account). You can be an undead superhero, a mad scientist, an Iron Man wannabe, or if you are me, create a tiger that kicks ♥♥♥ with martial arts or uses firearms to blow away minions.Story is pretty bland in a lot of places and some of the voice acting/lip and body animations will leave you cringing as you meet characters that are pretty clear ripoffs of superheroes like Iron Man, The Flash and organisations like S.H.I.E.L.D.Do I recommend this game? If you have the cash you are willing to input into the game for a gold sub then maybe yes but this game has a lot of things that needs fixing before it's close to anything mainstream. However if you can look past that, you can really get lost in the character creation system, creating many different heroes with varying powers from fire to poison to demonic powers to kinetic force."
2016-05-13,399070,True,"It's a short game yes as I finished it in about an hour but that hour has you playing a sad but heartwarming story about a baby dragon as he explores an unknown world and done entirely without the need for dialogue. I only played it once but it was enough for me since I got the best ending available and that is good enough for me since I am a sucker for good endings.K & M players might have some problems with the controls but playing it with a controller solves those issues easily enough having only to use the A, RB and LB Buttons as well as the stick for movement. The flying mechanic is a bit fiddly but once you learn how it works it becomes easy enough to fly with the best of them.Yes I am biased since I have a dragon icon but I still think its a good game regardless.It's a cheap under 5 buck experience that has a lot of heart to it and a recommendation from me."
2015-03-10,239140,True,"Dying Light is Techlands attempt at making their own version of Dead Island after breaking off from Deep Silver.On the surface the game is alright, the story is nothing too special though there are some moments where it might hit you in the feels if you grew attached to some of the characters, maybe not since you don't get much interaction with a lot of them throughout the game.The gameplay is where it really shows its strengths though, whilst it has a lot of things reminiscent of Dead Island like craftable mods, leveling/ranking system and so on, one thing that is drastically different is the implementation of parkour into its gameplay ala Mirror's Edge style.I will give that the parkour is a lot of fun to play around with especially with the Grappling hook which you unlock later in the game as you progress ranks. It lets you glide across the starting map and later on Sector 0 as you progress through the story, however that said its not always clear about exactly how extensive the range of what you can grab onto which can lead to a halt in flow or in some cases, death by gravity.There are colletibles in this game but I didn't care much for them and challenges are also present do 'x' in 'x' time, you know the drill. Some can be hard to do though and for someone like me who can sometimes take a game too seriously it does not help when the challenge giver insults you sometimes after failing said challenge.The crafting system is decent enough allowing you to craft things from medkits to throwing stars to elemental explosives later on when you unlock the ability to. However that said, the last boss of the game is an absolute joke, its basically one big QTE and you'd think they would have not done this since the last boss from Dead Island was good though bs in it's own right but that's just my opinion.In summary though I think it's a game worth playing for sure, the crafting system allows for some nice weapons, the parkour is fun and overall a good time. Though like most games it has its share of flaws.But regardless its a must play from me, though I maybe suggest waiting for a sale either on here or other sites that might offer it for a bit cheaper."
2014-04-08,8870,True,"I'm gonna just do a small review for each part so as I don't create a wall of text here:Main Game:The Good: The main game itself is good, solid gameplay, Vigors are fun to use and the story is interesting on how it plays with the notion of multiple universes. Elizabeth I will admit like many others is probably the best sidekick character to date, he is useful in battle with passing ammo, health, eve, opening tears etc and she does not need to be babysat like so many escort missions that could be named (RE4 anyone?).The Bad: While there is a nice variety of Vigors to use, you'll probably get to a point where you only stick with the use of two or three throughout most of the game. Controls are kind of weird but least you can rebind keys since I am one who does ADS a lot and having to press V to do so is kind of weird. Burial at Sea Ep 1:The Good: Seeing Rapture remade in the new engine is certainly a sight to behold and offers for a nice setting for this story. Elizabeth is useful like always, passing necessary supplies when needed and seeing familar characters from past Bioshock games are a welcome addition as well. New plasmid is useful at points and offers a new use in combat but I will touch on this again in the badThe Bad/Neutral: Length is nothing special, price I used to call into question until I began hearing of other games being even shorter and charging even more (some may know what I am referring to). New plasmid is useful at points and offers a new use in combat but it reminds me too much of the Winter Blast plasmid from the original Bioshock so its not really a new thing persay. Story was alright though not too sure what to think on it.Burial at Sea Ep 2:The Good: Play as Elizabeth finally, being able to see things through her eyes and even offers some more conversations between her and 'Booker', you'll know what I mean if you played it. Peeping Tom, a very useful plasmid to have to keep constant awareness of your surroundings, being able to see enemies through walls and turn invisible to set up sneak attacks on enemies. Provides a section where you take a trip back to Columbia so nice they did that.The Bad/Neutral: I am not too fond on the focus on stealth this time around though in thought, it does sort of makes sense since Elizabeth would be a more fragile character compared to Booker. No Tear control or even creation? I mean what the hell, it was a major component in both the main game and BAS ep 1 and they take it away? Lost points there with me. And the ending, oh god I hated that ending. It sort of makes sense but really even so that ending spoiled the time I waited for this DLC and it felt like a really sour way to make the curtain call with Irrational shutting down to move to Take Two Interactive. Then again I am the type of person who prefers a general happy ending like the good ending from the original Bioshock.Do I recommend this game? Yes for the most part, the gameplay is good throughout all eps though some may get turned off by the gameplay style change in BAS ep 2. Not much of a happy ending for your favourite characters either so while in one life they may be alright, in this one there is nothing much happy to be seen here.But the story is deep and intricate as it is but for someone like me who prefers an overall happy ending for the game and its characters, not really my favourite part of the game.Take it how you will."
2013-12-26,550,True,"Left 4 Dead 2 is critically acclaimed by a lot of people but I didn't find it all that, like so many other people. But to its credit it's fun to play (But only so long as you have friends, single player is boring really), its very mod friendly with tons of mods you can download and use from skins for your characters and weapons to redone animations to fully fledged levels so if you are the type of person who enjoys that sort of thing then this is a game for you.Not really my thing considering I almost never play it with friends ever, but if you have a good abundance of friends whom you play a lot of games with, this is certainly a title worth considering."
2013-12-04,241600,True,"Rogue Legacy is a good game for the price of purchase. It features randomised dungeons every time, though you can unlock a feature to lock the previous anscestors castle if you so choose so you can play through it again for anything you may have missed or failed the first time through at the cost of earning only 60% gold on the playthrough.Classes are all unique in their own ways with their own pros and cons (I personally preferred the Ninja/Hokage) and traits can provide some useful and not so useful mechanics to help or hinder you. Its a long grindfest at first since you are pretty weak at the start, but as you level up and upgrade your stats and equipment it does get somewhat easier though it still provides a challenge regardless.The story is kind of there but not all that interesting though there is a interesting plot twist at the very end, though story can be found as well through diary entries you will discover through your numerous playthroughs. It can be a long grind to the top but I find its worth it in the end."
