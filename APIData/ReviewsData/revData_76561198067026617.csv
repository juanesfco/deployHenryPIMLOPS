2014-07-14,304930,True,"Great game!Love it.If your into Survival your into this.if your into a zombie apaclypes then your into this.If you enjoy exploring with friends and working together, then you'll love this!Unturned his a Zombie apaclypes based up on a Minecraft/Roblox style.You can drive in Car's, Trucks ect.Yes you can swim but not underwater yet.This was an unexpected alpha game. i had much lower expectations for an alpha game"
2014-07-02,261820,True,Great Mod!Really shows Different Effects and pushes the Enviroment to realaity! Is this mod good?AMAZING! i was shocked when i saw this mod. Of course The stanley parable still stays in first place!But this game brings a decent storyline with a Apalypes type feeling.(similar feeling to Half life 1)Overall this game is DEFFINITLY worth the download. Cant wait for Act 2!
2014-04-05,440,True,"TF2 is mixed with lots of differnet things and can give you infinite gameplay! you got rocketjumping which is my persononal favourite, surf,team deathmatch,capture the flag and playload! thats just a couple of gamemode sections! The main idea for some is to kill. deathmatch. capture the flag ect. if you like gore this game is for you! if you like capture the flag this game is for you! if you like to learn new things such as surfing or rocketjumping that can come in handy during a real match then this game is for you! if you like unreal powers and the chance to be invisible then this game is for you! if you like a viroty of guns then this game is for you! i %110 RECOMEND you get this game! the graphics are placed in a way that it makes it feel speical and exciting when someone has no idea where u r what your doing as a spy. and as for rocketjumping and surfing something makes it feel so smooth and addictive! you just constantly keep practicing! and as it turns back you wont even know how good you really are. the best you can do is take a look at others! so i really do RECOMEND you get this game! its gotta be one of the best games in the store!"
2013-12-23,252490,True,A fantastic game! I've had it a very long time back (Near the release of the second update)The game was fantastic for its moment of beta.Now the 3rd update has been released and it is OUTSTANDING!I don't get to play it very often (Or used to) because it kept freezing. Soon after it was fixed!I do reccomend this game by all means!
