2016-04-30,227300,True,AI cars in this are ♥♥♥♥ing stupid but funny at times. I am definitely a fan of the Mercedes Actros. 8.5/10!
2016-04-03,244930,True,"This game is probably one of the best free to play games I've encountered. Seems like a mix of Skate 3, Qwop and Goat Simulator. Could do with some more clothing and some slight bugfixes but other than that, I hope it stays a free to play."
