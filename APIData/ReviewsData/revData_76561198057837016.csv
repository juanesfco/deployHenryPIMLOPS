2014-09-08,212680,True,"A difficult yet fun rogue-lite. Basically, you have to brave through 8 sectors to deliver the news that rebel fleets had defeated the Federation (with said fleet right behind you) before finally tackling their main flagship in order to cripple their force. Being a 'roguelike like' or rogue-lite, this is of course easier said than done. Gameplay-wise, you jump from beacon to another which contains choice-based text event like negotiating with enemy to let you off the hook, quest event, and many more. In combat, you have to power your system in order to activate its function (weapon system for launching attacks, teleporter for boarding, o2 chamber for supplying oxygen, etc) while you attempt to dispatch your enemy by either shooting it with weapons (requires heating it first before firing) or killing all enemy crew (any source, though mostly from boarding party). You can destroy their system by targeting your weapon at the system room to cripple them and generally make your life easier...although they CAN do that to you as well."
