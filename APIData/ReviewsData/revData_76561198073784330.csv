2015-05-22,214950,True,Ok so lets get started so Rom total war 2 So its a great game graphics are pretty campaign is smooth but complicated as always. So lets start with the bread and butter the best bit is the graphics are improved so much the controls are not as complicated for beginners. But lets get to the downside not mouch has changed or improved its all just like the original just has some nice graphics but not enough has changed so all up                     2.5/5
