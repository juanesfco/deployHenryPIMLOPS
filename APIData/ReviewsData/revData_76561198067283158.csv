There are also stats provided after each conclusion to see what other players have decided and to check if your case was solved correctly or not, and also see other players' moral choices."
2016-03-01,304030,True,"Best MMORPG I've ever played, 2000+ hrs on steam and another 2000+ hours without steam. Offers so many different things that pretty much caters for anyone, from farming potatoes to fighting enemies on the seas or running dungeons with friends/guild, killing world bosses, fishing/trade pack running etc. For those casual gamers, you can plant seeds/saplings and harvest them, combine them with other materials and craft into potions and many other things. You can also participate in rifts or even faction events in the seas/on land for honor in order to gem your gear. If fighting is not for you, go explore some pretty challenging-to-reach but amazing landscape ArcheAge has to offer, level up exploration proficiency and go treasure hunting."
