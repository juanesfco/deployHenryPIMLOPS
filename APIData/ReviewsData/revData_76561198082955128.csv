A very amazing and awesome storyline, 4 amazing characters to play as with all have great abilites, 3. Some crazy people you meet on the way, I am looking at you Tiny Tina, god that girl creeps me. And finally Borderlands 2 is just a very funny, fun, enjoyable game to play with yourself and friends and it has many easter eggs to it btw :D"
