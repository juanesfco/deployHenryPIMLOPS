Each playthrough randomly places the items in different locations, so theres aalot of different ways to complete the game10/10 would travel back in time to play as a kid"
2014-06-22,210550,True,Its angry birds but with gravity as the main mechanic. Its fun if you want to kill some time. The levels are always challenging when going for 3 stars. 8/10. they should lower the price permanently because without a special this is expensive.

2013-11-27,42140,True,A very good platforming puzzler that will keep you entertained for the whole time. Great visuals and soundtrack make it very relaxing to play. 8/10 the bird mechanics are a bit iffy if you dont constantly teleport it places. Definetly wait for a sale though.

Amazing game, every play through is different well over 100+ items, old and new bosses and new enemies, ability to view all what secrets you need in the game."
