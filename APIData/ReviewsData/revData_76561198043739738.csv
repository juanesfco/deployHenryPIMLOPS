2016-05-06,301640,True,"Decided to write this one a quick review because at the time of writing it's on sale. I bought this game a few months back when it was $20 and it was worth it. It's a fairly challenging coop shooter with Zombies and it's a lot of fun. Plus it's 3 games in one, so for $8.99 it's a steal. This game features the stories from NZA 1 and 2 with updated textures, an exclusive third story continuing on from the other two that you can only buy in this collection, and a decent survival mode which is also exclusive to the trillogy. All are available in 4 player coop.It has a fairly healthy online community, but it's certainly best with friends, which is why I don't have much time on it. That said, it has a certain dark humour to its story which makes it both endearing, but also a bit terrifying at times. If you're a fan of Call of Duty Zombies, particularly World at War, you'll probably love this. I have a fairly mid range PC (AMD FX-6300, R9 270x) and I run this at 80 fps 1080p on high with supersampling off and it runs beautifully. The graphics are pretty decent too.If using an Xbox controller is your thing, the controller support is fantastic. Simply turn it on at any point and it'll work just fine. I use a 360 controller, but the game most certainly supports an Xbone controller too (it's image is used in the controls section of the options).Basically, buy it now while it's on sale because it's great. If you happen to read this after a sale, it is still worth getting it over the other two if you want both."
2013-12-19,4000,True,This game is fun. But get CS: Source when you get it otherwise any maps that have a name like cs_example won't work because they are from CS: Source and most maps will have big floating red Errors and black and purple checkerboard wall textures (which is annother error). Look just buy them both they're good.

2016-04-08,10180,False,"I bought this game because years ago I loved it. It's a great shooter, a real classic of the genre. But, there is a really big problem. The PC version has very few people online and the system for joining games is a joke. Joining my second lobby, the game refused to load the game and it contiuned to do this. As a result I am refunding it.WARNING TO DLC BUYERS: There are very few games with DLC online and it's a waste having it."
2014-09-06,8930,True,"This game stole my life from me and made me a hermit. Then I bought the DLC. If you want to have your life stolen from you, click add to cart now. Enjoy."
2013-11-03,1250,True,Ok so here's what you'll do while playing this game: 'DIE UGLY ZOMBIE PEW PEW!!!!' That's what Killing Floor is. Go buy it. Now. Feed Gabe the contents of your wallet.
2015-08-16,222880,True,"First experience of Insurgency:- My team of terrorists are talking tactics, I'm a bit late to the match but we need to win this round.- Suddenly Jihad Jimmy shouts ALLAHU AKBAR.- WTF is going on?- Round starts, a man with C4 runs straight past me.- A couple of minutes in and I'm dead, there's two men left against three Americans.- It's Jihad Jimmy to the rescue.- Huge explosion- Everyone dead except one of our Allah-loving buddiesConclusion: If you want to be just like Jihad Jimmy or shoot a few Jihad Jimmys then you've come to the right place."
