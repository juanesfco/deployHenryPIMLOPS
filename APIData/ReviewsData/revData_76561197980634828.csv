2014-05-03,204100,False,"I have been playing FPS games since Doom first came out, and I have to say that in comparison to every other shooter that I have played, the gameplay in Max Payne 3 is truly disgusting.  Rarely will you ever come across repetitive tedious hard labour as hideous as this. The occassional bug that lets you fall thru the floor or get trapped in a wall comes as a refreshing break in the horrid mix of broken gameplay and cut-scenes which take away any weapon upgrades you have fought hard to achieve, either by switching you back to the single hand gun or simply removing all other weapons from your inventory, leaving you wondering why you worked so hard to get other weapons and ammo supplies, or even why they were dangled there to temp you in the first place.The most horrid aspect of fighting in MP3 would have to be this 'last man standing' feature which takes away all control in a gun fight and forces you to target on a single enemy who has dealt you a mighty blow, and somehow you are supposed to enjoy suddenly ripping your attention away from the fierce battle that had your full attention, and shoot just one enemy in slow motion, if you can, before dying.  Personally I would prefer if the game let me just do my own thing in a battle, and if I am hit with a killing shot then so be it.  Let me use my meds and battle sense to do it my way.  Last-man-standing is probably the most hateful feature I have ever encountered in a game.  Have I missed a feature that lets me turn that off?The greatest wonder I am left with is WHY I have spent so much time trying to complete this game and why I have not simply deleted all traces of it from my pooter."
