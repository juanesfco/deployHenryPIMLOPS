2016-04-08,397100,True,"DO YOU LIKE SIMPLE, EASY TO LEARN GAMES? WELLthis game probably isn't for you unless you're into learning alot of sh*t in the game.Machinecraft looks nice and IS nice but in the first hour of playing you will go 'WHY WON'T THIS WORK?!?!?' then you play for another few hourse then go 'HOW DO I MAKE THIS WORK!?!!?' then you hit the 10-hour mark. After 10 hrs of playing you can now make simple machines like a car, after 50 hrs you make your first plane, after a few 100 failed attempts on how to make and fly one ofcourse. Then the 100-hr mark and you can now make comples stuff but theyre not so polished, then the 200-hr mark (which I have currently), you make your first *insert a unique type of machine here*, after that you now realise that you could've done something with your life with the 200 hours you spent in the game. The game is proud of you, you, your friends, your family not so much."
