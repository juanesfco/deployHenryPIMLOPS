2014-03-22,207140,True,"This game... is amazing. Great gameplay, great level design, great graphics, and great music. This simple 2d platformer game is the most competitive game I have ever played. The level editor also adds much more playtime creating levels or playing community levels. And the best part is, it's still in beta! The only part that brings this game down is the 3-song soundtrack, which still sounds awesome. This game is a must have for all players. This game gets a 9.5/10!"
2015-12-04,391540,True,"This game, is AMAZING. I'm just going to get that out the way first up since I don't really know how to review this without spoiling EVERYTHING. And this is a game that NEEDS to be played blind. With all the jokes and story points it will not be as great of an experience if ANYTHING is spoiled for you, except for the secrets, maybe. Alright. Time for the ACTUAL review. Let's start with the soundtrack, since it can be described in one word: PERFECTHonestly, this is the best soundtrack I have ever heard. I love the use of both chiptune and real (recorded samples, maybe) instruments. Every song is superb and has its own place. If you were to ask me what my favourite track from the game is, I wouldn't be able to tell you. The graphics are very nice, reminiscent of consoles such as the Commodore 64 all the way to the Game Boy Advanced (Skipping one or two), and something else... (Not telling because it would spoil it, somewhat). They don't add or subtract anything (Except one part. You'll know what it is) but were worth mentioning anyway.The story has got to be the defining factor for this game. Without as great a story as this, the game would probably be a 'good' instead of 'OMG IT'S THE BEST GAME EVER' (Sorry). It isn't one of those games where the story is incredibly rich at the very beginning. It actually starts with a very small story that could be put into a 1980s NES game. However, the more you play, the more you explore and the more you want to find, you more you will find. There are just so many details that all correlate with each other. I can't really say anymore without spoiling some of the game, so you'll just have to trust me on this one. The gameplay is quite fun as well. Instead of having turns that bounce back between the player and the opponent, like a traditional JRPG, The player attacks with a simple QTE and dodges the enemy attacks like a Shoot em up. It's a very interesting and fun twist on the old way of battling. Undertale is easily my Game of the Year and possibly my favourite game EVER. (It's still contending with Terraria for the number one spot). Even though it isn't a game you can play over and over and over again, the quality of this game absolutely outstanding. So good job Toby Fox for making this brilliant game, and making me spend half an hour on a review. Final Score - 10.000000001/10(Someone will get that)TL;DR: IS BEST GAME GO BUY NOW!"
