Full of hackers and the developer refuses to acknowledge it or do anything about it, they refuse to patch in something to eliminate hackers. Reporting on this game serves about as much use as sticking your big toe in a bowl of hot water while trying to keep warm in Antarctica."
2015-10-01,346110,True,"Okay, so I finally stopped playing this game long enough to get around to doing a review for it (if that doesn't say enough as it is.) This game is by far, one of the best releases Steam has had in a long, long time. If you're into survival games, and need something to play that isn't the same old crap that is flooding the Steam games page, this is exactly what you're looking for.So the game is an 'open-world' survival, full of dinosaurs, the developers are commited, the updates are many and vast, it's quite rare that you see an 'Early Access' get followed through with by the developers and actually improved, most of them seem to just give up halfway through and stop development. But enough about the development end of this game (High five to the developers though, you're fantastic.) Let's move on to the actual gameplay and mechanics of this game.To start with, you spawn somewhere on an Island (Future maps are comming out, also a moddable game so go nuts.) with nothing but the underwear covering your ♥♥♥ and a chip in your arm. From there you punch a tree to get wood and thatch, collect rocks, and build your first primitive tool. After that the world is yours, if you wish you can go punch a Dodo in the face and make it your pet (Or if you're like me, you tame every Dodo you can find and amass an army to take over the Island. The Dodo King shall reign supreme!). It's very much a 'do what you wish, not what you have to' kind of game. If you want you can climb the Tech-Tree, building newer and better things, but it isn't necessary, you can simply go around raiding other people for tools if you wish, or if you're smart enough, kill some dino's and they drop stuff. If you're too lazy for that, go find a cave and run for your life through it until you find a supply crate (Supply crates are drops that land around the world, they're always full of goodies.)This is by far one of the best games I've seen on Steam in many many years, if you haven't bought it, do it now. If you have bought it, why are you reading this? Shouldn't you be playing?"
2015-09-06,291480,False,"By far the worst game on Steam, never have I ever seen such a failure of a game, how can you push a game with Microtransactions and have such a pathetic excuse for a votekick system. Hackers nearly every single round, can't votekick anyone unless they're on your team though. Did I mention this game has Microtransactions? Yes, you can pay real life money to get crappy pay 2 win weapons, armour, etc; not that it matters, because the hackers have basic guns and infinite headshots."
