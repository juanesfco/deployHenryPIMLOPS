There's very little interaction (save for finding extra scads of text to read) but the design is lovely. Walking Simulator is probably a bit derogatory for the game: it's closer to a guided story. There's nothing much to do but take in the setting and figure out what's going on - which is OK given that the settings are pretty impressive. I wish there were more to do, but I did enjoy it, as I did Dear Esther. Ending's a bit of a cop-out. Not for everyone, but really - how many people who like shmups are gonna buy this?"
