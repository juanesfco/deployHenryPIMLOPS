I checked the screenshots, and thought 'this doesn't look like a game I would enjoy'.I was very wrong.This is a very fun, intense murder spree. The music is great, the gameplay is very fun. It does take some practice to get going, but it definately worthwhile. I will be buying the sequel as soon it is released!Also, for those of you on steamboxes or linux, it runs great natively on linux!"
