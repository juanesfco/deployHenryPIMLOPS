2014-05-13,207210,False,At first glance it seemed like a pretty interestomg title making me easily think that the nostalgia would come back to me but that was short lived. If you have a 360 controller you might enjoy this title but for those who do not have a controller the ♥♥♥♥ poor keyboard controls and the inability to map them myself instantly put me off this title and to add to that the bugs and glitches feel alot worse than playing the original titles.for the hardcore group you may get a kick out of this but for everyone else I suggest you stay away.
2015-11-03,391540,True,At first I thought this wasn't my sort of game but after playing trhough it and completing teh true pacifist run I gotta say I enjoyed every bit of it. It had a great stroy behind it was well as many plot twist's you would discover along they way based on your actions. I deffinatly recommend this game to everyone but if your abit of an affectionate sort of dude/gal this game will hit you in the feels very hard.It did for meHOI

2012-07-24,48240,True,A sort of mix between city management such as simcity with a mix of civillisation(without the turn based gameplay). I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city building type games with a bit of combat mied into it :)The only thing that will probably bother you is that this game is integrated into uplay(not sure wether that has been changed) which may irritate some users since you are pretty much launching the game through  two game managment programs.
2014-03-19,245550,False,When i first looked at the title I thought it would be a documentary based an all aspects of free to play games but not its pretty much to me just a giant dota2 commercial and switched me off after a couple of minutes and no offence but that 5gigabytes is going to be used for something the will acutally provide me with entertainment thanks.
2013-12-19,219640,True,Think team fortress 2 except instead of a heavy you are a knight coated with armor armed with a razor sharp longsword ready to gut your enemies. This game is enjoyable to play becuase the ways the weapons work differently and each one has its own unique way of striking at your enemies. New players might get abit frustrated at first but once you get used to it it becomes  an enjoyable experiance.
2013-03-22,225140,True,"A blast from the past a must have for those who enjoy a good classic fps. Redicilous weapons, good humour and none of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t storyline that holds your hand just straight up fps goodness ^_^"
