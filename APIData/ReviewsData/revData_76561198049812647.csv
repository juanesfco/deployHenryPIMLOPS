The way the cars undulate and bend when crashing would give game programmers from the 90s seizures. (well I got a little spastic too but that's another story.) It's a little glitchy here and there, maybe even a crash, but my pc seems to run the game well if there are no major issues. (I have a beast laptop) the only things that I think need changing are just the sound effects. Very well conceived game. 9.2/10"

2015-10-15,232090,False,"I used to LOVE this game. Seriously. I played it for hours on end. Hell, I even leveled up all my perks to lvl 25. But the new updates killed this game. The bezerker was MEANT to tank, now he is just a slow low health help-while-you-can sorta perk. The M14 is hilariously undepowered, and the hard difficulty feels harder than HoE. Let me quote the the Tripwire team. 'Early Access Done Right'. What a joke."
