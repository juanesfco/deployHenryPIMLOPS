2014-12-24,319050,True,"Chaos Reborn is a nice hidden gem at the end of the year of 2014This would have to be the best game to appear as an early access game on Steam to date. Gameplay is great and fun to play, the random draws of the spells and easy to learn mechanics of the game mean that If you are new to the game then you will not have a hard time playing against someone who has sunk several hours into the game. Some would say that makes the game unbalanced but I see it as away to let new people to the game be on a fair playing felid with players who have had more time to play. Cards (spells) are unlocked as you level up, maps vary in size depending on how many people are playing. So far you can play 1v1, 1v1v1, 1v1v1v1 & 2v2 online, with a spectator & offline mode also available. The game offers so much fun already, I look forward what awaits in the coming year and for the full release."
