2014-09-17,219150,True,"I got all the achievements for this game. Super replayable, fun as hell. Pretty much anybody should play this game unless you have a short temper. Mega hype for the sequel. This game will never leave my memory as the first I 100%ed and one of the best games I've ever played. 10/10."
