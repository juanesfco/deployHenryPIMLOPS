2016-07-26,274170,True,"This game is an astounding breakthrough on modern top-down shooters, even leading on to other games, a custom level workshop for campaigns and single levels, and even figurines. This deserves the 3rd game of the series, Midnight Animal, to be even better than the other 2 games. Hotline Miami 3: Midnight Animal, will probably make a more astounding comeback in the series, even if its not by the real developers."
