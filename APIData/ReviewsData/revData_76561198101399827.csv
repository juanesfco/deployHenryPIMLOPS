2016-05-13,295110,True,"I just LOVE this game, I just bought it friday, expecting nothing good. When I got on it and spawned way out in the middle of nowhere I thought, *ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING KIDDING ME* this will now be just like DayZ..... A wolf then chases me out of the forest and I come upon a road, I run, eh a few miles with no hope. I search through a car and find a can of grammys chickin. So I find a guy, he tries talking on his mic but hes not saying anything.I run into a small area above these plots, looked like they were going to build houses there. I run inside a trailer and hear something outside.... Immediatley two guys are conversating on there mics, I then hide in the bathroom of this little trailer.... I hear two gunshots and hear other people on mics. I exit out of the back and run for the woods....I come upon a small little neighborhood, theres three guys terrorizing another guy, I thought id save him. I got blown up....Me and a friend make plans to go to.... D5, It sayd there was a police station there so all I could think of was guns, lets get our hands on guns.... We travel towards D5 from I7, so were walking through the hills and such, all of a sudden we come upon a house, its pitch black and this house is near a pond. We watch around us and zombies start pilling up. We start heading back to D5 now, we come upon a river and theres 30+ player made bases. We can see this massive town (at the time I didnt know D5 was a massive town, I just thought it was a police station XD  ) So were running towards the town, I hear a gunshot and I got killed. My friend panicked and ran towards the apartments. Atm im thinking of quitting the game, I got killed and itd take me FOREVER to get back here again.... My friend hides in an apartment.So I go to click Respawn and lord and behold, I respawned in D5... Right next to the apartment my friend was in. We found some guns in the apartment. Were running down the street and we look behind us and theres 20 guys with guns and helmets running and shooting at us. We got cornerd, tourtured, and murderd... My friend decided to get off and I respawn next to a gas station, I was then held at gunpoint and asked to take mt clothes off.. Hes ready to pull the trigger and all of a sudden a car comes out of nowhere and runs him over. I then hop in the car and the battery dies and we got cornerd by the group of 20 people...... R.I.P Car Dude...To end this little thing, the next day I decided to play some more H1Z1, I find a zombie and he has an ak47, helmet, awesome pants, and a sick backpack with alot of supplies on him.... Thank god for player zombies :DId recomend this game to my future kids... oh yeah, Im not even married yet..10/10 Id go thru all this hell again just to find the police station...P.S, I still dont know where it is, I got lost then run over by a car in D5....."
2016-04-24,282560,True,"Im loving every single minute of it, glad I bought it, only *issue* ive run into is when the park reaches 2,000+ peeps, the lag is unberable, and it crashes. Other than that I enjoy customizing the cars for the coasters or the colors of the paths or que lines. I enjoy the fact that the peeps have a mind of their own. Some dont like to ride certain rides, some only like roller coasters.The Coaster Builder. - Took me alot of time to get used to, forgetting to use shift to make it rise, or tilt. I enjoy the fact that some coasters can spin, reminded me of *Thrillville off the rails*.I enjoy the fact that the mascots seem to make everyone happy. I also enjoy that there are SO MANY differnt food buildings, theres like 4 different buildings just for tacos and salads!!!One thing that I really really enjoy is that I can ramp the paths, like, I made a little river, so I boosted the path up to go over the river, and I put a wooden rollercoaster track under and over it, so My peeps can enjoy a good coaster on the entrance of the park. The performance isnt 10/10, nor is the FPS, but it is playable....Im surprised my FPS lasted pretty good with the ammount of items and peeps in the park, there were around 1,800 peeps in the park and over hundreds of differnt pieces. 6 Roller coasters spread out all over. 60+ food buildings, 8 mechanic buildings with 10 mechanics for each building. 5 entertainer buildings, once again 10 entertainers for each building. 9 Janitor buildings, 10 janitors for each building. atleast 80 plants and trees, a lake, and over 10 thrill / family / and Junior rides..... Peeps arent to bad, yeah they walk through each other, but eventually theres so many peeps in your park you dont even notice it. Peeps - 8/10Id rate the game 8/10Path Placement - 7/10"
2015-12-09,271590,True,"hmmmm....... Its GTA, what can you expect. You kill people, blow crap up, kill people, a few drugs, hoars on every corner, blow more stuff up. Story is great. Onliine is hacky. Its all just peachy!!!!!!!!"
2014-02-03,35450,True,"Amazing game, graphics are set to low when you first start, amazing battle expirence. Dificulty is similar to ARMA, this is a $10 game with 4 games inside it. Amazing action game."
2016-01-05,377160,True,All i have to say is the gunplay is 9/10 i can actaully kill things when i shoot them!!!!!
2016-05-13,252950,False,"Not a bad game, but it gets old after about 30mins...."
2015-12-02,252490,True,"Great game, its nothing like ARK:Survival Evolved. The Building is quick and easy. It is challenging to shoot at other people, and some raids can go on for hours. Very fun game, of you like PVP, and PVE you will want this game. Highly Recomend, 10/10."
2015-04-12,333950,True,"Welll........ This game is frickin amazing, if you like building this is a have to have game. Its not hard to control like 'Space Engineers' This game is amazingly fun. the Structal Integrity is amazing aswell. I love the fact that the building is very very easy and once your on the game your hookedl. I highly Recomend this game for its building, tree cutting and destruction, and the pure fun. Multiplayer will come out in later updates."
