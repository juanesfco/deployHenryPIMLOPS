Hard mode makes me run for dear life and still dies.9/10 (i want the next sequel dammit!)so far there are no routes but its nice to play for the story lines first.some say the game's too hard even on normal mode but thats for you to decide, not themKey pointers for the game: Sunrider should have 7/5/4 on kinetic(minimum) shield and +1 range 125energy(for 5 flak rounds)Chigara and claude should have a a range of 2 (+5 shield power is optional)Sola should have +7atk 130 energy and 65%kinetic energy usage(~$300 cheaper) acc is optional but recomended2allience cruiser are very importantuse all guard to fight against overwhelming missles and laserschigara has repair boosters that adds 200hp morecomplete all missionsthese are the most basic set up and pointers i use when i play on captain mode. have fun"
