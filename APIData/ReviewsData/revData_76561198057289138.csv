2014-02-25,221100,True,"This is an amazing game, but donâ€™t be fooled, this is no shooter. When I first started playing I was thinking, 'Great a zombie survival shooter' wrong, if that is how you look at this game you will not have fun, but once you start to play this game as a survival game it becomes a lot more fun and a lot more strategic. So get ready for an adventure because this game is going to take you on one.Hang on and enjoy the ride"
