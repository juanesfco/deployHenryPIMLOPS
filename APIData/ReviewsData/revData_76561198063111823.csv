You cannot go wrong witht his game, personally it is worth the money but fot those on the fence if my review hasn't coaxed you over the edge then perhaps you would perfer to wait till this game goes on sale as it frequently does and cease tht opportunity to further your PayDay experience. In Conclusion the game , as you can tell from its populrity, well made and without a doubt is worth having."
