2016-02-20,420110,True," Right, so. Let me just start this off saying. I dont read many visual novels. Like. At all. But one day, I picked up Nekopara Volume one. AND LOVED IT. So with the relese of Nekopara Vol 2, I've decided I care not who reads this as I sip on my whiskey and chuckle at the cat girl shenianigins that are unfolding on my screen, and tell you why I love this visual novel, and indeed this newfound series I've come to enjoy. It'll make you laugh.. alot. The amount of times I've been thrown into stitches of laughter from the strange happenings going on in front of me. Is astronomical. And the artwork changes to fit the mood accordingly. It's just so positive and light hearted! It'll make you cry.. or worry.. If you're one of those people like me, who gets attached to characters easly then you truly feel the hardships they face, or indeed worry about kittens crossing the road (seriously, from happy to concerned in 0.5) then you will love the drama that tends to unfold. It'll give you a nose bleed... Or more. The artwork is certainly amazing, and depending on which.. *cough* 'version' you have. You'll certainly be pre-occupied with what is going on in your screen, take that as you will... HOLY FUDGE YOU CAN PAT CATGIRLS YES GENTLEMEN AND CATGIRLS, YOU HEARD RIGHT. YOU CAN NOW GIVE YOUR FAVORITE CATS SOME ADORABLE HEADPATS.All in all. I rate this game. a : I was so amazed a needed to post a review before I finished out of 10."
