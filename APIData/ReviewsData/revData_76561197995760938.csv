2015-11-20,330840,False,"A huge disappointment.This game comes REALLY close to emulating the quality of the show, but because of poor writing and the flawed template that Telltale uses, it ends up being a frustrating, tedious experience. Your choices don't mattter - the game revels in not giving you any control over what happens, and then blaming you for every character's constant failures. And its frustrating, because the game starts strong with well-written and well-voiced protagonists. But because its using a licensed property, nothing you can do can impact on the world. And that's REALLY frustating when the antagonist is already a cannon character. Apart from that - the game engine is hideous, the dialogue choices feel limited, the writing has new characters feel like cartoonish characatures, and all gameplay is either pressing a direction for movement, repeatedly pressing q then e or walking around for 2 minute spurts. What a bummer, episode 1 and 3 have some quality writing, but the rest just do not live up to the name."
2015-06-16,239350,True,"I've owned this game on my PS3 for two years, and despite a few breaks, have played the daily challenge almost every day ever since then. Spelunky is a masterpiece of puzzle design and exploration. This is a game that literally changes genre as you get better at it, making it so, so hard to get tired of. When you start its just an overly difficult puzzle platformer, but once you realise the world has extremely consistent rules and patterns, deeper the rabbit hole goes. Bats become moving bouncy platforms, giant horrifying spiders become sticky-web vendors and rats become the ultimate trap-triggering, arrow baning godscend. It's a VERY steep learning curve, and not everyone will get past the frustrating amount of platforming precision required. Spelunky will break you many, many times. But each time you rebuild yourself, you realise you're evolving your playstyle and are becoming completely different erudite beast."
2015-02-09,203160,True,"A mixed bag of a game with some terrific gameplay moments that are overshadowed by a cliche-ridden origin story that doesn't quite sell the 'origin' of Laura Croft. The game spends too much time obsessing over a literal transformation where our protagonist has the ♥♥♥♥ beat out of her, without having any realistic/interesting developments. The game is good, although it overdoes combat a bit and does not have any real exploration apart from a few optional tombs. Nonetheless, there are a few fantastic moments where the map opens up and you're unleashed into a playground, ready to take out some bad dudes. Despite being released in the last gen, Tomb Raider feels like an original next-gen game that makes you think 'but holy ♥♥♥♥, the sequel could be incredible' much like Assasin's Creed 1 or Uncharted. Recommended only for the potential of the game series itself, not the character, having a new start that could maybe turn into an immensly satisfying and well-crafted sequel."
2014-11-22,239200,False,"A Machine For Pigs is positively one of the most dull games I have ever played. While the sense of abject fear and its triggers can vary from person to person, I found this game does very little in the way of actually attempting to scare you. The majority of the game is spent fumbling around in the titular machine looking for the next gate or doorway that the game has opened for you, while solving puzzles you fail to see the purpose of, as well as following a story the game refuses to explain to you. The monsters are not scary as you're not punished for looking at them, and you pretty much know what they are and why they exist from the start. There's a lacking fear of the unknown to their presence really.The game didn't really fool me - perhaps I've played too many games, but I could pretty accurately determine whether or not I should expect a monster, and the majority  of the time I did not, and nothing appeared. Its boring and devoid of enemies and basic survival mechanics in the same way that the 3rd Penumbra was. Don't bother."
2013-12-29,205100,True,"Not since Deus Ex have I played a game such that each level is not a single path - but a non-linear environment that the player manipulates to reach their goals. Whilst its number of options and pathways is comparatively limited, Dishonered does a fantastic job of letting the player feel like they're playing their own way rather than playing from a set list of options. Whilst every encounter still feels based on the standard 'stealth until caught' monikier, you're given a lot of toys that really colour every level's detailed high-rising rooftops, awesome-yet-impractical mechanical foundations and its seedy rat-infested underbelly. Dishonered doesn't have a fantastic story (it's actually pretty trite), but its setting is fantastic and every area feels designed with actual city architecture and infrustructure in mind. Scuttling through seemingly-clean bakeries inside a rat or sneaking through filtration vents as murderous angler fish provide alternate routes that feel a part of the world and not convinient security holes. Dunwall is a 'Whalepunk' empire of Victorian routes with excessive wealth and crumbling poverty-striken foundations. One moment you're challenging a duke to a duel outside of a fancy party, the next you're poisoning water at a gang-owned rundown textile mill for a crazy old lady called 'Granny Rags.' Whilst there is definitely more room in future sequels for more unique environments, Dishonered feels like a decent tour of a bizarre and gritty world.It does lose its pacing towards the end, but Dishonered still feels like a funtastic romp through a miserable metropolis."
2013-07-08,203810,True,"A boring and somewhat pretentious museum that thinks that flowery pose equals depth. It has some stunning moments, and the music is fantastic, but the user interaction seems so pointless and inconsequential that you really feel like you're just swimming through the game's ego. Excellently made, but not at all fun to play."
