2015-11-24,223470,True,"This game is awesome. The references are ♥♥♥♥ing great, just take a look at the achievements,it's tenfold in the actual game!The humor content in this game alone, makes it a great purchase!Best factor for me, aside from the humor, is how great the melee weapons are. Everyone of them feels so ♥♥♥♥ing great and distinct at the same time! Scythe, machete, sledgehammer, axe, grass-trimmer and many, many more! Such a blast sledgehammering a dude in the face and throwing the scythe at a random guy, haha. With so many different kinds of weapons plus the diferrent ways to do each mission, the game has good replayability. If you love satire and crude humor, you will love this game. This game never fails at putting a great big smile at my face, I'm still laughing at 'Employees only, no infidels allowed'The only downside, aside from a couple of trivial bug is the distance you need to walk between objectives. But when armed with a sledgehammer, you cover distance in no time without realising it lelelel"
2015-10-03,570,True,Get 4 friends to play this with and it never gets boring.
2015-08-15,284460,True,"This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. If you like portal, get this game. Level design is beyond sick."
2013-08-27,10680,False,"Single player is awesome. Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥. If you think its going to be an avp2 experience, look away my friends, look away.Predators are overpowered. Expect games where predators outnumber both aliens AND marines combined. Not as rare as one might think.You might be thinking 'Oh, i'll be going alien, surely since its a melee only class i must have an advantage in close combat, or at the very least, a teeny tiny advantage.' HAHAHAHAHA!Nice balance.The entire combat premise of this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing rock-paper-scissors farcical. Light attack beats heavy, block beats light and heavy beat block.As expected, heavy does more damage + has a longer casting animaton. BUT, you can actually CANCEL the animation by blocking! So you can make it look like you're going to heavy attack, and then immediately transition to a block! WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DOES THIS EXIST?What is the ♥♥♥♥ing point of creating a rock-paper-scissors mechanic if you are going to radically change the entire god damn premise of it?The previous avp games were filled with intense fast paced multiplayer action! And this one is just, disappointing. If you are going to have a rock-paper-scissors combat, ♥♥♥♥ing do it properly! God!"
2013-08-27,1250,True,Very very VERY fun game. Well worth your money. A must have for zombie game fans.
