A dedicated modding community will cater to your every whim, providing realism, longevity to the game and so much fun. You wont regret getting this game, and it still has even more potential, as at the time of writing was only beginning beta. This game will help you to see the wonder of the univers, and give you a great respect for everyone involved in real spaceflight over the years."

Perfect combination of art, music, storytelling, voice, and gameplay, putting it up there with the likes of Portal 2 and Bastion as near perfect games.Cannot reccomend highly enough, this game is worth every cent, and an experience you must have."
