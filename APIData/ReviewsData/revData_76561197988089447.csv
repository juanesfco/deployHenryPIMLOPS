2015-12-18,32370,True,D&D meets Star Wars! Great dialog and cinematics looks better than G.Lucas's 90's SW remastered CGI. Deep lore and story where the wrong press of a button can take the dark path with any encounter.Sweet 16:9 wide screen patch works like a charm. http://www.wsgf.org/article/star-wars-knights-old-republic
2015-06-18,209000,True,Didnt even know this had multiplayer! great singleplayer as always but just as good multiplayer to support endgame.
2015-04-07,65930,True,"Wow after all the haters and price drop i had low expectations for this game, I hope more XCOM from now on are super slow motion turn based. t makes it more intense. I didnt like the old fassion genre but it has some XCOM lore wich is kool and after you get alien weapons you forget its the 1970's. The only bad thing I have to say about it is the price on release. But you can jag it for under $10 ;)8.5 / 10I'd recommend using a controller because it has a gears of war feel to it."
