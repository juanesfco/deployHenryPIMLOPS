The game has one or two glitches, but which game doesn't?It is fast paced, and sometimes can be irritating with combat with campaign. This is because most levels allow you to be a jedi/sith after a few small missions, but if you die you basically are screwed for the rest of the match. This isn't neccesarily a bad thing though, as I play on the hardest difficulty (there are only two). The game is fun, has heaps of replay ability and I would definitely recommend the game to everyone I know. Star Wars Battlefront II gets a 10/10 from me!"
