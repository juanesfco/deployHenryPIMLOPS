2014-11-03,273350,True,"This game is exetremely fun! And it's only in Alpha, even though i haven't played it for long i think it somehow one of the best games on my steam list, Although I have hardly played it, AND it doesn't have many features at all it is still good, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys shooters and things of that genre. (That means you CoD players)"
