2015-07-10,333930,True,"great game, regardless the fact that its still beta (with forgivable glitches). the best thing about this is it is one of those few games that arent pay 2 win, and you dont need a tryhard computer to actually enjoy it. its a concoction of the teamwork of tf2 with the gunplay of cod, although i would recommend the devs to add more guns for one merc and a customization option"
