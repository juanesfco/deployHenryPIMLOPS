2015-06-22,107410,True,This game is a must have.
2015-06-22,105600,True,"This game has to be one of the greatest games I have ever played. Lots of people hate this game because its a 'Minecraft clone' and the poeple who say that the most are the ones who either have not played it or have but played it for 10 or so minutes. Minecraft may be a bigger and more well known game but this one has to be the better one out of the 2, Content wise. This may be a 2d game but dont let that fool you as people say 2d will take the fun out of the game. In this case it makes it more fun. In the end if I could, I would rate a 9.5/10. LOVE IT!"
