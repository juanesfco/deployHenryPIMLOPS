2015-10-25,230410,True,Although I can't say that i'm the most avid player of this game (i know people who achieved over 1000 hours) its still quite fun with a lot of potential left in store for thisalthough there is one thing I can say for sure....THIS IS WAY BETTER THAN DESTINY AND ITS FREE

2015-10-25,8850,False,I was surprised by this game to say the least as I just couldn't get into it regardless of how much i wanted to play something bioshock related...maybe its because your a big daddy but i can see where people will like it but i'm just gonna have to stay away until I feel like giving it a shot again.
2015-10-25,8870,True,This game has such a great atmosphere with an engaging story and great music that its hard to believe that some people haven't played it yetif your looking for a FPS with a great story then you have to play this (after you play the originals of course)
