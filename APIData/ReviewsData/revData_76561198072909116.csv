I didnt even touch the story mode when I first got it, because I just couldnt stop hunting captains and war cheifs and things like that. I have around 80 hours and I have only 84% on the game.If you want a game that is fun, challenging and also time consuming Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is for you!"
2015-08-06,253030,True,I downloaded Race The Sun for free when I saw my friend playing it. I am glad I did. The game is stunning and very addictive. I have intalled it on my school laptop to play in spare time. Race the sun is a great time killing game. A game to play after a hard day.
