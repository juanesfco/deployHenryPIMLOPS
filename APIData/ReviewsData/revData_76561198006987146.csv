It opens up different concequences and dialogue. Though, not being able to skip dialogue made the second play-through for achievements a bit too time consuming. I also find Christopher Lloyd a bit off-putting as a voice actor."

So many boxes are broken and wasted in between obstacles. Some sections took me 15mins to clear, others took me over 2 hours of gameplay because of the difficulty and slim chances of the planets aligning to make the objective possible to complete."
