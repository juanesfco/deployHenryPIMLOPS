2016-09-09,436520,True,This is a good but buggy game i can recommend that you pay the $10 if you are wondering why when people are saying this is F2P later you get $36 of free content for paying to support the devs and yes you are paying for closed betaThe Pros-it's fun and with friends its quite a blast-it's $10 pretty good price to support the game-heaps of unlockables -feels like the good olden days of Combat arms before it was crap-have not encounterd a hacker yet -community seems to not be toxic-non P2W game you need to pay for absoultly nothing if you want it and you get alot of ingame credits so you usally can get the gear you want without paying The cons -some guns feel extremly unbalenced-it hasnt got stable ping for me on any servers -the game has a very small community currently im hoping more people will buy this-its a bit buggy-the menu is quite clunkyoverall i would recommend this game and i hope more people do so we get an larger community whilst supporting the devs to contiune this game it has real potential and i quite enjoy it
2015-01-16,107410,True,"This game is one of the most polished bohiema interactive games i will write this review in catgorieys i hope you agree with meGameplay - SinglePlayer  3 - 5 The singleplayer is ok the campaign was not as good as the others and that is why i give it a 3 out of a 5 as i would not replay this campaign Content  - Vanilla 2 - 5 in arma 3 Vanilla the content is pritty much recycled for examples there are like 10 varients of a MX rifle and not many default vechicles and thats why i would rate Content for the Vanilla 2 out of 5Content - Add-ons 5-5 The main thing about arma is that the DLC is made by mostly the communtiy aka Free - Addons you can get addons that add more weapons, more Vehicles, More Infentry and MUCH MORE!!!! making the addons for content a perfect 5 Vehicles - Handling and Models 4-5 The Vehicle play in arma aka handling is not really that good but the Models are amazing and have had alot of hard work put in them making this catgory a 4 Mission Editor - aka the editor that allows people to make a misson 5 - 5The Mission editor is spectacular in arma 3 and should allway be used want to make a halo dive misson you can make it want to make a infiltration mission you can do it want to make a stealth misson you can do it making a perfect 5Overall 9 - 10 Arma 3 is deffintly worth a buy i would recomend it if you are a hardcore fan of arma 2 the addons add huge amounts of replability i hope you get this game and enjoy it the Multiplayer gets a 5-5 since its so amazing i would reccomed this game to anyone who is a fan of Arma games"
2015-08-19,386070,True,"I remember the good old days of Planetary Annihilationthis game doesn't fully change the game but adds a new stratgey to the gamewith the new units, So can i recommend this game yes why? you might ask here is some reasons- They added Titans- They added new Units- They seem to have modified some of the current systems- Fixed some major bugs- Added new game mode now here is why i think this game deservese a thumbs up because all this content could just be a dlc- i believe the devs will add more updates to this game and make this eventually worth the money.- i believe that the game great new game changing units which completely change the strategyhere are a few cons that need to be patched- OP the new units are op for example the manhatten which isn't even a titan it's just a heavy armormed tank that has a nuke attached to it and can seriously end the game in around 7 minutes if your both on the same planet. - The orbital titan also feels as if it needs a patch as it travels really fast and ends the game fast.but here is the good result from these new units - The previous stratgy u used is gone, you need to make a new stratgy, because the new units will completey crush your stratgy - If your having a one v one games can go alot fasterSo thats my review i give this game a 8/10"
