However, its not without its bugs. There were a few minor bugs thats were more of an inconvenience than anything else and easy to work around, like health pots not giving health, then you have the big bugs, UI not disappearing when you unpause (restart game to fix), falling through the world, (exit to menu and restart to fix), enemies taking at least 100 hits and still not dieing (reinstall to fix). Then you have my situation were i had to skype call me chinese friend and screen share to know what was being said on the little scrolls that appear, and finally figuring out how to beat the first area, go to options, set lock mode to hold, hold shift for the rest of the game while pressing f near enemies and spaming mouse buttons.Overall it is a good game, but needs a little more attention than a english translation."
