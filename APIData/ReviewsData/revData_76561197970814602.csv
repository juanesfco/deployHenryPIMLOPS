While most game developers would aim to build on existing positives, X Rebirth's devs have taken everything GOOD about the original games, and thrown them completely out of the window in order to squeeze in some 'pretty new graphics', which in all honesty, aren't that impressive to begin with and seem more of a throwback to mid 2000's graphics engines. The removal of third person views, multiple ship control, gate travel (a new 'taxi tube' system has been developed to shuttle your ship from system to system, which is absolutely TERRIBLE) and many 'new features' are actually fancy detractions from what made the original X series so great. The addition of being able to walk around in stations sounded great at first, but is extremely limited in it's function and serves no great logical purpose to the game that couldn't be solved easier with menus and communications channels, except to make the game boringly and frustratingly mundane each time you are forced to wander around stations upon docking. Trade is just about non-functional, often causing game-breaking errors and lockups, and combat although beautiful to watch is just as broken. I am sorry to say that I was duped into pre-ordering this game with the promise of great things... It's a shame it was all a sham, and that no attempt to fix the issues has been made (even though that would basically mean re-releasing the entire game). Save yourself some money (and sanity); DO NOT buy this pile of steaming cowpat!"

2015-12-20,346110,False,"A little story to describe my game experience in ARK: Survival Evolved... I had supported this game since the beginning, so don't get the idea I was a newbro, had rolled up over 700 hours in a few months alone.I was recently globally banned (yes, GLOBALLY, as in ALL servers, not just the one I was on) for refusing to change my Tribe name from the band name 'CKY'. When I questioned the admin who threatened me with expulsion why I had to change it, he globally banned me. When I contacted Studio Wildcard directly to repeal the ban, and even went as far to send video and screen captured evidence of the conversations, I was completely ignored. I now have a basically useless game on my Steam list, all due to an over-zealous ban happy admin with an itchy button-finger.Also, the admin banned my partner's account for no reason whatsoever, just 'in case' I was playing on her account too. It's not often you get server admins and developers who are LESS mature than their player base. Thanks Wildcard!Oh, also the frame rate sucks even on modern super computers, and the gameplay is kind of stale in the current market.1/10 - Simply because I was able to drown most of my own dinos before he banned me. Would ride a TRex into the ocean depths again! ;)"
