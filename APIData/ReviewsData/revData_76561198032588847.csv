2016-04-02,394310,True,"Addictive. Nice pixel art style. One of my favorites to play, a bit grindy with money management and training stats while keeping them from falling, but the overall game is well done and you can enjoy it. There is many references in this game to popular movies you all should of seen. I like the tone of this game and if there was a Punch Club 2, I'd buy it."
2015-04-28,327890,False,"Really bad game, I bought it because I was interested in the control system and how the physics were (not the actual gameplay or 'story' ha) I shouldn't of watched PewDiePie play it up on Youtube, conned me to wasting money on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game,  it also has a timer during play like you would find IRL arcades, Looks like a dev project that is only made so the developer can learn how to make an actual game, shouldn't be sold on steam, it should be a free browser game if it even can be, I don't know, I'm not reinstalling this to find out."
2015-09-24,331500,False,"Very disappointed in this game and the gameplay dynamic totally took me by surprise, was a let down the screenshots make this game look better than it is, stuck at the start keep getting killed within the first 2 minutes. Shouldn't waste 15 good dollars on this game, plenty of better games out there, probably for cheaper too! I uninstalled.Update: I reinstalled to try again. The Tutorials are NOT very inviting, So I felt like I was going back in time when I had to force myself to read the manual. Yet the robotic tutorial voice is not so great, so it is very hard to follow the tutorial videos, they should have a replay button or something. It just ends and you think...'So what did it just tell me?' ...Also the tutorials were not synched up to what I was doing. They start by a trigger event, but that fails to realise what I have done, very frustrating and I believe most of them had more than one area covered in the one time play, tutorial videos.This caused me to try different things at random and it didn't feel fun. I was playing a solo game against no-one like it said on the main menu to get familiar with the game. Unfortunately this leads me to thinking that there is really only one starting path to choose from, and setting up your base with the essentials just seem tedious, which is why Im not bothering to start a me vs AI game because I feel I need to know exactly how to play the game and know every technology path JUST so I wont die miserably, and even if I did I still won't be having fun with this game. Why? because there is no learning curve in my opinion, you have to know it all before playing it by reading up the guides on it, leading me to think that mostly this game was for the creator and people who play multi because there is many faults that need to be fixed.1. Interior doors should be closed and locked to begin with!2. I found a bug, after taking direct control of a robot in the field, I exited back into the RTS view, problem was that THEN the WASD keys stopped working for moving around the base in RTS view, luckily I had the radar reseached and built so I was able to continue by moving around with clicks on the map!3. Another bug! On the RTS view, you can only 'drag select' units, not a simple left click... ?4. The map seems to small for a 4vs4 game5. Thats all I have so far, Im still unsure whether I want to play this again, But I might if the dev addresses these issues soon!Unfortunately at this time I cannot recommend anyone buy this game."
