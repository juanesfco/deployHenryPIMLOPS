2014-07-25,304930,True,"Fun, open world zombie survival game. Good multiplayer. Interesting Mechanics."
2014-04-21,244850,False,"Used to be a good game. Now it runs like ♥♥♥♥ and has a bunch of 'content' (i use that word Loosely). I would not recommend buying this until they optimize the ♥♥♥♥ out of this.Pros:- Creative sandbox with space- Functional physicsCons:- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse of a survival mode- Remove the Dogs, they're a lame excuse for AI and are annoying rather than a challenge- Runs like ♥♥♥♥Summary: Used to be Good, Dev's got lazy, poorly optimized - Don't buy yet."
2014-02-02,252490,True,"I believe this game has some great potential and is generally going in the right direction. I will be interested in the way they will implement the 'Thirst' system as currently water is pretty hard to find. I think one of the biggest problems with this game is hackers and 'Naked' hunters. But this can be solved by good administration and some fair rules. Personally speaking, i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good, realistic survival game with great multiplayer and interesting features."
