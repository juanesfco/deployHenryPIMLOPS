2013-12-10,440,True,"This is the best FPS Game Ever.....The Reason for this is because most of it is really balanced and the only weapons that can headshot you are Sniper Rifles and The Ambassador unlike all those other FPSs which you die instantly if you get shot there.If this is your first time playing this game I reccomend you to start as a Soldier because I think he is the most balanced and easiest, so don't play as the complicated ones like Spy and Sniper.I give this10/10"
