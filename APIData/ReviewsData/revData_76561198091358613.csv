2015-03-25,63500,True,"Not the best of games, but still pretty fun. I got this game during Awesomenauts Star Storm Kickstarter as part of my donation package (which I still havent gotten all of yet DX) and I had some fun for the time I've played it. Not a game I thought I would like, but I play it every time and time again"

2013-12-23,4000,True,"All mods from half life have become a standalone game (The Stanley Parapables, This game, ect) and they all have been great and Garry's Mod is no exception with your Gravity Gun and Physics Gun from Half Life 2 and the Tool Gun you can make a rocket propelled bathtub, a nuclear powered wheel chair and so much more. This game has a great Single Player mode giving you time to make amazing creation without the harasment of others. Multiplayer is great, playing with friends or with random people and its always different! I recommend this game to everyone, but to get the full experience you will need to pay a bit extra to get games that add more (Counter Strike Source, Half Life 2, ect) but it is worth it in the end by adding more gamemodes like TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) by getting Counter Strike Source. Defidently get this game (With Counter Strike Source). 10/10"
