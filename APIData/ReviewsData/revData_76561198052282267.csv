2013-12-15,24860,True,Battlefield 2 is a great classic shooter which i have enjoyed very much in past years. Although now very much outdated by recent shooters and Battlefield games. The modding community is definetely keeping this game alive. Project reality and FH2 are both great mods which I will be playing for a while yet. :D Peace out!
