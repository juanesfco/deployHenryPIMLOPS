2015-12-30,243470,False,"♥♥♥♥♥♥ Game. Not worth any price. Pirate it if you really have to play it...but its not worth it, no matter what the price. (Not even worth $1). Played better games that were free such as 'How do you do it'. Story and Gameplay is average but gets SUPER repetitive (Like alot)"
