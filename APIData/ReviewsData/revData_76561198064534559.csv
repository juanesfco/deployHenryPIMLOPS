2015-12-11,211420,True,"This game is best summarized as a pilgrimage. It's hard at first, but once you get used to it, it becomes all consuming. I got so invested in this game back when i only played on Xbox 360, that i ended sinking in 400 hours accross 6 or 7 characters. And when i finally finished the game, i felt so sad, knowing that i would never again enjoy a game as much as i did with Dark souls. It's just so perfect, challenging, but also VERY rewarding. I urge you to pick this gem up, and play through it atleast once. Although, believe me when i say you won't be able to stop."

2014-04-26,730,False,"Good game at it's core, decent shooting mechanics, with game modes and weapon skins that keep you playing. But it's ruined by it's horrible matchmaking system, and a community so braindead and toxic it may as ♥♥♥♥ing well by a huge sea of radioactive trash."
