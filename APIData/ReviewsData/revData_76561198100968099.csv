2015-05-26,263540,False,"I don't mind the graphics but this game is just another boring and generic MMO with SO MANY BUGS. This game is also fun and friendly but the vim system is annoying. It also has very boring combat. I played ranger and all it did was choose an enemy, shoot at enemy, run from enemy and repeat. 0/10"

2014-04-21,271290,True,This is an amazing game. There are mechs and stuff u can unlock. One of the best FPS`s i have ever played. I like playing team deathmatch with others and the co-op is amazing.
