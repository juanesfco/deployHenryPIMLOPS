2014-12-06,271290,True,"Un joc fain cu un concept unic.Am jucat multe jocuri shooter. Acesta este special deoarece conduci un robot, astfel neputand sa faci multe lucruri(sa te pui pe burta, sa stai cat mai ascuns posibil, etc.).Recomand jocul!"

2016-08-25,496920,True,"No spoilers. You can relax.Wow. This game.Don't worry about the 8bit graphics, the story is mindblowing. And yes, it's not a jumpscare tipe of horror. The environment will surprise you later in game. The twist at the end if verry nicely done. It's better to see for yourself.The game is 4-6 minutes long, depends how you play it, but i am about to do a 3rd run :D I can't stop playing it.Simple tips. WASD moving SPACE for interaction and at the end don't press SPACE. You have to press ENTER bacuse SPACE will close the game and the action won't be completed. "
2016-05-12,107410,True,"This is a very good game and it simulates a normal timed war very good. Sincerely, I never saw other games doing what arms series accomplished.Now the bad thing is that you really have to be patient.vafterall it's an tactical fps.The game modes, some of them are cf funny, some are full with very skilled players.Conclusion. Definitely gonna play again with a friend"
