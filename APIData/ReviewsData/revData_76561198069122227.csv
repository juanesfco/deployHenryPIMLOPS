2015-10-30,304930,True,"Great game cannot be compared to any other because it is very different.A day in the great world of unturned....Spawns naked lost, hungry, thirsty and coldsee a guy with a gun and you ask him for medicine, he slowly grabs it out and while he is in inventory you smash his with a rock, you steal his gun and his gear. You find other people and one shot them from a mile away. You build a base in the middle of no-where and guard it for the rest of your life."
