Go forth, City Builder devotee! Cast off the yoke of always on DRM and crippled gameplay, and follow the true heir of Sim City 4 into the valley of light and expandable city limits!Just like I'm still playing Sim City 4 a decade after it's launch, I imagine I will be coming back to Cities: Skylines in ten years from now."

2016-07-04,282070,True,"Fight off rival thugs, the military and the homeless to become Pogoren's next moonshine tycoon! Can you manage your scarce resources and turn a band of untrained strangers to into a ruthless moonshine producing cartel? Loot, steal, shoot and stab your way to glory in this indie smash hit!(fantasies like this are the only way I can justify the terrible things I make my characters do in this game)"
