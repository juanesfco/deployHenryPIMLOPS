Definately worth the $20.Great job guys, i look forward to tapping some more trees soon! :D"
2013-09-20,4000,True,Great game.... admit it... you just want it to pose the ragdoll in sexual positions.... ;P
2015-08-14,251850,False,It has a ♥♥♥♥-load of 'ambiguous packages'... and crashes every time on the Unreal engine intro sequence. Why does it do this? Does anyone else get this?
2015-02-25,239220,False,every single time i go to play 'unknown error'...... normally i'd recommend.
2014-02-11,261820,False,"Not bad, definately NOT the worst game i've played but i wouldn't recommend it all the same.WAY too close to HL2 and it's a bit weird to play at first but you get over it once the story lures you in.Poorly placed ammo and no melee weapon to compensate. I mean, come on guys, you can do better than that."
