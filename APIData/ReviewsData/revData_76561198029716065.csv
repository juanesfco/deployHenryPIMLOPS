2013-12-18,4000,True,Amazing game with endless potential for entertainment.I reccommend that you get the CS:S + GM pack as most of the extra game mods use CS:S.
2016-02-18,274230,False,This game is hot trash and steals all of its mechanics from Gun Point. Honestly the most disappointing game Devolver Digital has ever pulished.
