The only difference is that this rage game has the balls to charge you for this crap.One of the main selling points of this game is the music. Is it good? No, the music is annoyingly repetitive. Although I admit it does sound good for the first 2 levels of the game before you realise that it is practically the same thing over and over. Not only that, but there is no other sound at all. Just the sounds of jumping over rocks and trash cans. Also, there are these 'powerup' things that go from Hyper to Mega to Ultra to Extra, and they make the game sound more lively each time. Sounds cool right? Wrong. The music does get more lively until you get to Extra, which turns the music into low, slow sounds that break up your pacing and eventually leads to you losing the level. Speaking of levels...The level design, don't even get me started on the level design. First of all, no checkpoints? Really? I get that it is a kind of 'music' (if you could even call this music) game so you wouldn't want the 'song' to be broken up, but the game is so insanely difficult that it takes more than 30 minutes for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2 minute level. Who thought this was a good idea? ALso, some of the powerups are in difficult to get places, which is good for a running game like this. The only problem is that some of these powerups are almost completely impossible to get. One powerup involves you jumping down a hole then springing back up. The problem here is that the spring throws you into a wall, which of course kills you instantly.So, the rating is probably what you want to see from this random guy on the internet.2/10 - Not recommended to all who wish to keep their sanity."
